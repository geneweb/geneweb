val f :
  string option -> int -> int -> int option ->
    (Unix.sockaddr * string list -> string -> string -> unit) -> unit
   (* [Wserver.f addr port tmout maxc g] starts an elementary
       httpd server at port [port] in the current machine. The variable
       [addr] is [Some the-address-to-use] or [None] for any of the
       available addresses of the present machine. The port number is
       any number greater than 1024 (to create a client < 1024, you must be
       root). At each connection, the function [g] is called:
       [g (addr, request) scr cont] where [addr] is the client identification
       socket, [request] the browser request, [scr] the script name (extracted
       from [request]) and [cont] the stdin contents . The function
       [g] has [tmout] seconds to answer some text on standard output.
       If [maxc] is [Some n], maximum [n] clients can be treated at the
       same time; [None] means no limit. See the example below. *)

val close_connection : unit -> unit

val printf : ('a, unit, string, unit) format4 -> 'a
    (* To be called to print page contents. *)

val print_string : string -> unit
    (* To be called to print page contents. *)

val header : ('a, unit, string, unit) format4 -> 'a
    (* To print an http header line *)

val wflush : unit -> unit
    (* To flush page contents print. *)

val http : httpStatus -> unit
    (* [Wserver.http answer] sends the http header where [answer]
       represents the answer status. If empty string, "200 OK" is assumed. *)

val http_redirect_temporarily : string -> unit
    (* [Wserver.http_redirect url] sends the http header where [url]
       represents the Location where the request needs to be redirected. *)

val encode : string -> string
    (* [Wserver.encode s] encodes the string [s] in another string
       where spaces and special characters are coded. This allows
       to put such strings in html links <a href=...>. This is
       the same encoding done by Web browsers in forms. *)

val decode : string -> string
    (* [Wserver.decode s] does the inverse job than [Wserver.code],
       restoring the initial string. The heading and trailing spaces
       are stripped. *)

val gen_decode : bool -> string -> string
    (* Like above but heading and trailing spaces are stripped
       only if bool parameter is True. [decode] = [gen_decode True]. *)

val extract_param : string -> char -> string list -> string
    (* [extract_param name stopc request] can be used to extract some
       parameter from a browser [request] (list of strings); [name]
       is a string which should match the beginning of a request line,
       [stopc] is a character ending the request line. For example, the
       string request has been obtained by: [extract_param "GET /" ' '].
       Answers the empty string if the parameter is not found. *)

val get_request_and_content : char Stream.t -> string list * string

val wsocket : unit -> Unix.file_descr

val sock_in : string ref
val sock_out : string ref
    (* Names of the files used in windows implementation to communicate
       http requests and html answers. Default "wserver.sin" and
       "wserver.sou". Can have relative or absolute paths. *)
val stop_server : string ref
    (* Name of the file whose presence tells the server to stop (at least
       one request is necessary to unfreeze the server to make it check
       that this file exits. Default "STOP_SERVER". Can have relative
       or absolute path. *)

(* Example:

   - Source program "foo.ml":
        Wserver.f None 2371 60 None
           (fun _ s _ ->
              Wserver.http Wserver.OK;
              Wserver.printf "You said: %s...\n" s);;
   - Compilation:
        ocamlc -custom unix.cma -cclib -lunix wserver.cmo foo.ml
   - Run:
        ./a.out
   - Launch a Web browser and open the location:
        http://localhost:2368/hello   (but see the remark below)
   - You should see a new page displaying the text:
        You said: hello...

  Possible problem: if the browser says that it cannot connect to
      "localhost:2368",
  try:
      "localhost.domain:2368" (the domain where your machine is)
      "127.0.0.1:2368"
      "machine:2368"          (your machine name)
      "machine.domain:2368"   (your machine name)
      "addr:2368"             (your machine internet address)
