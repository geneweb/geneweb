(* [decline dform dformat] encode name that could be declined (like in the czech language)
   and its declination form in more comprehensible for computer format.
   Declination form [dform] is one of the follows:
   - 'n' for nominative
   - 'a' for accusative
   - 'g' for genitif
   Declination format [dformat] describes how does a name changes throughout different
   declination forms comparing to the nominative form.
   See {{: https://geneweb.tuxfamily.org/wiki/declension }Declination in Geneweb} for more details.
   Example 1: [decline 'a' "Vladana:a:Vladanu:g:Vladany"] returns encoding "@(@(a)@(a?Vladanu:g?Vladany:Vladana))."
   Example 2: [decline 'a' "Vladana:a:-u:g:-y"] returns encoding "@(@(a)Vladan@(a?u:g?y:a))"
