val forbidden_char : char list
(** List of forbidden to use characters *)

val next_chars_if_equiv : string -> int -> string -> int -> (int * int) option
(** [next_chars_if_equiv s1 i1 s2 i2] checks if UTF-8 characters that start at position
    [i1] inside [s1] and at [i2] inside [s2] are equivalent (have the same ASCII representation).
    In this case returns position of the next charecter for each of them. Otherwise, returns None. *)

val lower : string -> string
(** Convert every letter to lowercase and use *unidecode* library to
    represent unicode characters with ASCII. Non-alphanumeric characters
    (except '.') are replaced by space. *)

val title : string -> string
(** Apply uppercasing to the first letter of each name (sequence of alphabetic characters) part,
    and lowercasing to the rest of the text. *)

val abbrev : string -> string
(** Remplace by an abbreviation or remove particles inside the name *)

val strip : string -> string
(** Removes all the spaces inside the name *)

val strip_c : string -> char -> string
(** [strip_c s c] removes all the occurences of [c] inside the name *)

val purge : string -> string
(** Removes all the forbiden characters from [forbidden_char] inside the name *)

val crush : string -> string
(** A custom sonnex/soundex-like phonetic algorithm:
     - no spaces
     - roman numbers are keeped
     - vowels are suppressed, except in words starting with a vowel,
       where this vowel is converted into "e"
     - "k" and "q" replaced by "c"
     - "y" replaced by "i"
     - "z" replaced by "s"
     - "ph" replaced by "f"
     - others "h" deleted
     - s at end of words are deleted
     - no double lowercase consons *)

val strip_lower : string -> string
(** Equivalent to [strip o lower]. Used as:
   - First comparison of names.
   - Comparison for first names and surnames. *)

val crush_lower : string -> string
(** Equivalent to [crush o abbrev o lower]. Used as:
   - Second comparison of names.
   - Key when index by names *)

val concat : string -> string -> string
(** [concat fn sn] is [fn ^ " " ^ sn] but faster. *)

val contains_forbidden_char : string -> bool
(** [contains_forbidden_char s] is [true] iif s contains forbidden characters *)

val split_callback : (int -> int -> unit) -> string -> unit
(** [split_callback fn s]
    Same as [split], but call [fn] with substring indexes instead of building
    a list *)

val split : string -> string list
(** [split s] split the name [s] in parts composing it.
    e.g. [split "Foo-Bar Baz"] is [[ "Foo" ; "Bar"; "Baz"]] *)
