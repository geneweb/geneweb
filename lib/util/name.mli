(** List of forbidden to use characters *)
val forbidden_char : char list

(** [unaccent_utf_8 lower s i] checks UTF-8 characher that starts at position [i] inside [s] 
    and returns couple (cs,np) where [cs] is ASCII representation of this character (characters 
    between 0x00 and 0x7F) and [np] it's a position of next utf8 character inside [s]. If [lower] 
    is true then [cs] will contain only lowercase letters. 
    Example : unaccent_utf_8 "aÈa" 1 -> ("e",3) *)
val unaccent_utf_8 : bool -> string -> int -> string * int

(** [next_chars_if_equiv s1 i1 s2 i2] checks if UTF-8 characters that start at position 
    [i1] inside [s1] and at [i2] inside [s2] are equivalent (have the same ASCII representation). 
    In this case returns position of the next charecter for each of them. Otherwise, returns None. *)
val next_chars_if_equiv : string -> int -> string -> int -> (int * int) option

(** Convert every letter to lowercase and use *unidecode* library to
    represent unicode characters with ASCII. Non-alphanumeric characters
    (except '.') are remplaced by space. *)
val lower : string -> string

(** Apply uppercasing to the first letter of each name (sequence of alphabetic characters) part,
    and lowercasing to the rest of the text. *)
val title : string -> string

(** Remplace by an abbreviation or remove particles inside the name *)
val abbrev : string -> string

(** Removes all the spaces inside the name *)
val strip : string -> string

(** [strip_c s c] removes all the occurences of [c] inside the name *)
val strip_c : string -> char -> string

(** Removes all the forbiden characters from [forbidden_char] inside the name *)
val purge : string -> string

(** Converts name to the following format:
     - no spaces
     - roman numbers are keeped
     - vowels are suppressed, except in words starting with a vowel,
       where this vowel is converted into "e"
     - "k" and "q" replaced by "c"
     - "y" replaced by "i"
     - "z" replaced by "s"
     - "ph" replaced by "f"
     - others "h" deleted
     - s at thr end of words are deleted
     - no double lowercase consons *)
val crush : string -> string
   
(** Equivalent to [strip o lower]. Used as: 
   - First comparison of names.
   - Comparison for first names and surnames. *)
val strip_lower : string -> string

(** Equivalent to [crush o abbrev o lower]. Used as: 
   - Second comparison of names.
   - Key when index by names *)
val crush_lower : string -> string

(** [concat fn sn] is [fn ^ " " ^ sn] but faster. *)
val concat : string -> string -> string

(** [split_sname_callback fn s]
    Same as [split_sname], but call [fn] with substring indexes instead of building
    a list *)
val split_sname_callback : (int -> int -> unit) -> string -> unit

(** [split_fname_callback fn s]
    Same as [split_fname], but call [fn] with substring indexes instead of building
    a list *)
val split_fname_callback : (int -> int -> unit) -> string -> unit

(** [split_sname s] split the surname [s] in parts composing it.
    e.g. [split_sname base "Foo-Bar"] is [[ "Foo" ; "Bar"]] *)
val split_sname  : string -> string list

(** [split_fname s] split the string [s] representing multiple first names
    into this list of firstname.
    e.g. [split_fname base "Foo-Bar Baz"] is [[ "Foo-Bar" ; "Baz"]] *)
val split_fname : string -> string list
