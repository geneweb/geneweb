val leap_year : int -> bool
(** Says if the given year is a leap year. *)

val nb_days_in_month : int -> int -> int
(** Returns number of days for the given month and year for
    gregorian calendar. Takes into account leap years. *)

val time_elapsed : Def.dmy -> Def.dmy -> Def.dmy
(** [time_elapsed start stop]
    Compute the time elapsed between [start] and [stop].
    If [stop] is prior to [start], resulting [dmy]'s field
    are negative (but correct).
    Resulting [prec] can be:
    - [Sure] for exact duration
    - [Before] for "less than" duration
    - [After] for "more than" duration
    - [Maybe] for other cases
    Used to compare only gregorian calendar's dates.
 *)

val time_elapsed_opt : Def.dmy -> Def.dmy -> Def.dmy option
(** Same as [time_elapsed], but will return [None]
    if computation is not possible
    (e.g. time_elapsed_opt /1839 /1859). *)

val date_of_death : Def.death -> Adef.date option
(** Returns date of death if present. *)

val dmy_of_dmy2 : dmy2 -> dmy
(** [dmy_of_dmy2 dmy2]
    Convert a [dmy2] to [dmy] using [Sure] as precision. *)

exception Not_comparable
(** [Not_comparable] is raised by [compare_dmy] and [compare_date] when
    [strict] mode is used and precision of dates are incompatibles to
    have a reliable result (e.g. is [compare_dmy 2019 07/2019]) or when
    one of the date in [compare_date] is [Dtext]. *)

val compare_dmy : ?strict:bool -> dmy -> dmy -> int
(** [compare_dmy ?strict d1 d2]
    Return a negative integer if [d1] is prior to [d2],
    [0] if [d1] is equal to [d2],
    and a positive integer if [d2] is prior to [d1].
    [strict] parameter enable or disable strict mode, and
    is false by default (see [Not_comparable])
*)

val compare_dmy_opt : ?strict:bool -> dmy -> dmy -> int option
(** [compare_dmy_opt ?strict d1 d2]
    Same as [compare_dmy], but do not raise an exception
*)

val compare_date : ?strict:bool -> date -> date -> int
(** [compare_date d1 d2]
    If both [d1] and [d2] are [Dgreg] date, uses [compare_dmy]
    to compare them.
    [Dtext] dates are always considered prior to any [Dgreg] date,
    and equal to any other [Dtext] date.
    [strict] parameter enable or disable strict mode, and
    is false by default (see [Not_comparable])
