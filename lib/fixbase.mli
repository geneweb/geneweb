(** All the function of this module scan the base and fix what is considered as corrupted data.

    They all share a same signature : [let check_XXX ?report progress base = ...]

    The optionnal [report] function should be used to track changes.

    [progress i max] keep tracks of the progress of a task. When called, task is
    about [i/max] done.

    Note that it does not actually commit the changes, so if you do not want a dry run, apply
