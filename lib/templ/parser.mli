(** [parse ?cached ~on_exn ~find src] parses [src] and expands included
    templates.
    - [cached] option enables caching of the parsing process.
      The default is [true].
    - [resolve_include] function resolves paths for included files.
    - [on_exn] callback handles exceptions raised during included template
      parsing, providing both the exception and its backtrace. *)
