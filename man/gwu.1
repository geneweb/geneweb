.B  \-c <num>
When a person is born less than <num> years ago, it is not exported unless
it is Public. All the spouses and descendants are also censored.
.TP
.B  \-sep "1st_name.num surname"
To use together with the option "-odir": separate this person and
all his ancestors and descendants sharing the same surname. All the
concerned families are displayed on standard output instead of their
associated files. This option can be used several times.
.TP
.B  \-sep_only_file <file>
With option "-sep", tells to separate only groups of that file.
.TP
.B  \-sep_limit <num>
When using the option "-sep", groups of families can become isolated
in the files. Gwu reconnects them to the separated families (i.e.
displays them to standard output) if the size of these groups is less
than 21. The present option changes this limit.
