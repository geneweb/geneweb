OVERVIEW:

Dag2html generates HTML code from a DAG. It is well adapted for
genealogic DAGs (it is used in the software GeneWeb, same author) but
may be used for any kind of DAG.

It generates HTML tables. The display is therefore horizontally
extensible. But it cannot be visible in browsers like Lynx which does
not treat tables. Moreover the lines cannot cross: to resolve this
problem, nodes are sometimes duplicated.

This is the version 1.02.

To compile, you need the Objective Caml compiler which can be found at:
   http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/
and Camlp5 at:

INSTALLATION:

Just do "make" to make it.
To install it, do "make install".

Examples of dags can be found in directory "ex": just type
   dag2html ex/dagfile
The syntax can be easily deducted from these examples.

Usage can be found by typing
   dag2html -help
