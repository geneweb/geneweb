OVERVIEW:

gwdiff will help you to target differences between two GeneWeb databases. So
far it needs your help to know what to compare. Two modes are available:

 - descendants checks (option -d): it will compare the descendants of the
    person you have found in both databases (Spouses and their parents are
    compared too)

 - descendants of all ascendants (option -ad): it will found ascendants of the 
    person you have found in both databases that are available in both data
    bases. For each top person identified, it will compare its decendants in
    both databases.

USAGE:

Your cousin has just sent you a new GEDCOM file, import it to GeneWeb (data
base b1). You want to update your database (b2) according to b1 database.
Now, find a person defined in both databases (ex.: Jean DUPONT). In base b1,
it is "Jean.0 DUPONT"; in base b2, it is "Jean.3 DUPONT". Run the following
command:

 gwdiff -d -1 Jean 0 DUPONT -2 Jean 3 DUPONT b1 b2

If your are interested in the descendants of its ascendants, you can try:

 gwdiff -ad -1 Jean 0 DUPONT -2 Jean 3 DUPONT b1 b2

So far, the checks include:
 - first name: value from b1 has to be found in b2 (first name or first name
    aliases)
 - surname: value from b1 has to be found in b2 (surname or surname aliases)
 - birth date
 - birth place: if it is set in b1, it has to be set in b2 (whatever the value)
 - death status
 - death date
 - death place: if it is set in b1, it has to be set in b2 (whatever the value)
 - occupation: if it is set in b1, it has to be set in b2 (whatever the value)
 - marriage date
 - marriage place: if it is set in b1, it has to be set in b2 (whatever the
    value)
 - divorce date
 - spouses
 - parents of spouses
 - children
