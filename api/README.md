OVERVIEW:

GeneWeb is a genealogy software with a Web interface. It can be used
off-line or as a Web service.

This is an API which works just like GeneWeb (e.g. it's a web server).
The difference is that instead of sending HTML, it uses the Google
Protocol Buffer to exchange informations encoded as pb, json, xml.
