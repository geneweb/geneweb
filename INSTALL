INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN UNIX or MACOSX MACHINES

For the compilation, you need the Objective Caml compiler installed
in your computer. The compilation works for several versions of ocaml.
You also need the preprocessor camlp5.

They freely distributed at address:
     http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/
     http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/camlp5/

1- In the top directory, do:
      ./configure

2- Do:
      make

   If your platform does not have the command ocamlopt, the
   executables will be slower.

3- Do:
      make distrib

   This creates a directory "distribution" where all executables programs
   and documentation are copied.

   This can constitute a "distribution" directory if you want to distribute
   executables.

4- To use GeneWeb, move the directory "distribution" to another place, or
   rename it.
   On macOSX, do:
   	   make install
   This will install the distribution folder on your Desktop and rename it "GeneWeb-7.00-Mac" 
   (or another name of your choice).

   Go to this directory and launch the commands "./gwd" and possibly "./gwsetup".
   On macOSX, geneweb.command will kill previous instances, launch both gwd and gwsetup 
   and minimize the window.

   The reason why it is much better to move this directory is that "make clean"
   deletes it, and another "make distrib" overwrites it. If you created
   genealogic databases inside, they would be deleted.


INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN WINDOWS NT/95/98

You need:

- The Cygnus GNU-Win32 development tool, free (search in the Web)

- The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

- The Microsoft Assembler masm.

- The Objective Caml compiler.

- The Camlp5 preprocessor.

Follow the same instructions above than for the Unix installation.
