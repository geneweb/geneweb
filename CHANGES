GeneWeb version 3.09
--------------------

* GeneWeb server or CGI (gwd)
  - [04 Nov 00] Improved forum displaying.
  - [04 Nov 00] Fixed bug: when merging two persons, the possible notes
    of the second person could disappear.
  - [03 Nov 00] In tree display, when "images" is selected,
    also display spouses' images.
  - [02 Nov 00] Added "subject" in forum.
  - [02 Nov 00] Now display French republican years in roman digits.
  - [01 Nov 00] In nobility title display, added a link to display the
    tree of their relationship links. The tree contains only six persons
    at the same time (and a link for the next ones).
  - [28 Oct 00] Added a trace of the last "wizard" accesses (in the
    file cnt/base_w.txt). The idea is to know if some "wizards" are no
    more using their connections. Applies only to wizards defined in the
    file of the variable "wizard_passwd_file" of the file base.gwf.
  - [26 Oct 00] In forum, added "<table>..</table>" around messages
    to prevent unterminated tags to perturbate the other messages.
  - [24 Oct 00] In family updating, when there is a name conflict while
    creating a person, now proposes to try again with the first free number
    Lightly changed the interface for the same situation in person updating
    (code written by Ludovic Ledieu).
  - [20 Oct 00] In family updating, added a check that (created) persons
    are born before their death: this check was missing.
  - [11 Oct 00] Important improvement: added a system of template
    files for the personal pages. It is therefore possible to change the
    displaying of the personal pages, by editing the template. It is also
    possible, for a site accomodating several data bases, to have a
    personal template file specific to each data base.

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt)
  - [23 Oct 00] Updated Hebrew version (Jonathan B. Marder)

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [03 Oct 00] Fixed bug: there were an inconsistency between "gwc"
    and the inline updating, for persons "keys": the inline updating
    considered spaces in names as significant but not "gwc". Result:
    when cleaning up a data base (gwu + gwc) or when importing a data
    base from an old version of GeneWeb, it could cause names conflict
    errors (for example if both "Anne.0 Le Blanc" and "Anne.0 Leblanc"
    were defined).

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [17 Oct 00] Fixed bug: problem of accessing persons with the same
    names when they contained declinations (Czech names, for example).

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu) and GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [28 Oct 00] Added option "-c <num>" not to export people born since
    less than <num> years nor their descendants (code written by Ludovic
    Ledieu).

* GeneWeb data bases Transfer Program (gwtp)
  - [29 Oct 00] Fixed bug: if one tried to send a data base several
    times at the same time (by several requests), it could create a
    corrupted data base or it could make the program fail.
  - [06 Oct 00] Added ability to put a trailer text.

* Setup program (gwsetup)
  - [19 Oct 00] Updated Swedish version (Lars Gustavsson)

* Documentation
  - [19 Oct 00] Updated Swedish documentation (Lars Gustavsson)

GeneWeb version 3.08
--------------------

* Setup program (gwsetup)
  - [21 Sep 00] Fixed bug: in recovery from an old version, if the
    destination data base already existed (created e.g. by a previous
    attempt), it could not overwrite the data base, even it pretended
    it was going to do it. Same problem (fixed also) for the creation
    of a data base from a GeneWeb source file.

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [25 Sep 00] When wizard or friend access failure, now display the
    page without the priviliged access (instead of just saying "access
    failure").
  - [21 Sep 00] When modifying a person, forbid now to let his/her
    first name or surname as just "?", because it can cause problems
    of linking these persons after a data base cleanup.
  - [18 Sep 00] In family updating, when creating an unknown person
    (i.e. having "?" as firstname or surname), does not set the "source"
    field any more for this person.
  - [18 Sep 00] Fixed bugs: 1/ while merging persons, automatic merging
    sometimes used to loose the death date 2/ while merging families
    the comment of the 2nd family used to be ignored.
  - [15 Sep 00] In ascendants long display, added notes for siblings if
    any (they were missing).
  - [14 Sep 00] In update page, if the person's sex is unknown, the
    selection "add family" proposes now two case according to the sex.
  - [13 Sep 00] Fixed bug: problem of age at death in descendants page,
    the same bug than for personal pages fixed 16 Aug (version 3.07).
  - [05 Sep 00] Fixed bug: in ancestors surnames list, under Lynx
    (browser for alphanumeric terminals), sometimes displayed "incorrect
    request" when clicking on certain surnames.
  - [04 Sep 00] Fixed bug: in descendants with encoding, for children
    married several times, could sometimes display the father's name
    instead of a repetition of the child's name.
  - [01 Sep 00] Fixed short dates: "between 1935 and 1938" is displayed
    now "1935/1938" instead of "ca 1935/1938".
  - [30 Aug 00] Fixed bug: sometimes accepted two persons with the same
    key. E.g.: after having defined "Charles de Gaulle" and "Charles
    Degaulle", when changing the second person' s surname into "de Gaulle",
    did not display a name conflict error.
  - [28 Aug 00] Added option "-wjf" (= wizard just friend) to permanently
    prevent all wizards in all data bases to make changes.
  - [26 Aug 00] In descendants page, added male line and female line.
  - [25 Aug 00] In history, added the ability to see the changes only
    by a given wizard.
  - [24 Aug 00] Fixed bug: when entering Web addresses (http://...)
    in notes, it generates enclosing HTML code to make links, but
    sometimes it did it incorrectly. For example the image insertion
    <img src=...>? did not work because the program changed it into
    <img src=<a href=http://...>>

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb) and GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [31 Aug 00] All surnames aliases (instead of only the first one) are
    now saved and restored.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [02 Oct 00] Fixed bug: did not treat begin or end dates in titles
    when defined as texts.
  - [28 Sep 00] Strip now possible tabulations found in the GEDCOM.
  - [26 Aug 00] If -epn (which is default) and -lf, tries now to lowercase
    the public names.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [06 Sep 00] Fixed bug: newlines in notes were incorrectly saved,
    resulting that when restoring the data base (ged2gwb), the lines
    were catenated without any spaces.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged) and GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)
  - [02 Oct 00] Fixed problem: when selecting somebody's ancestors, links to
    relations (godparents, for example) were included, even if these relation
    were not selected.
  - [29 Aug 00] Now, when option "-d" (descendants of) is applied, the
    spouses' parents are included, except if the option "-nsp" is given.

* Geneweb compiler (gwc)
  - [25 Sep 00] Replaced option "-shift #" by "-sep": the file following
    the "-sep" option is treated as separated from the rest, i.e. the numbers
    in persons keys are automatically shifted if in conflict with the persons
    of the previous files. No more need to find a "shift" number which avoids
    the conflicts. Simplifies the data bases merging.
  - [27 Aug 00] Fixed bug: date e.g. "between 1300 and 1350 Julian" where
    printed by gwu as 1300..1350J but gwc expected 1300J..1350 and resulted
    in a syntax error.   

* GeneWeb data bases Transfer Program (gwtp)
  - [08 Sep 00] Added small documentation (a README file) for GeneWeb
    Web site administrators.

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [29 Sep 00] The change, (version 3.06, 17 Jun 00) about can_send_image
    supposed to be yes by default, did not work: fixed.
  - [20 Sep 00] Deleted the change version 3.07 (on date: 28 Jul 00) about
    the variable body_prop. Return to the previous behavior: defined as
    empty or not defined => the default GeneWeb background is used. This
    change was necessary 1/ by consistency with other variables 2/ to
    make gwtp work correctly.

* Documentation:
  - [25..27 Sep 00] Changed in the chapters "merge.htm" and "divide.htm" the
    explanations about the separation of input files to avoid conflicts, using
    now the new option "-sep" of "gwc" instead of "-shift" (see change in gwc
    above, 25 Sep 00).
  - [09..25 Sep 00] Updated German version (Falko Trojahn).
  - [24 Sep 00] Added a chapter (gwformat.htm) about the GeneWeb source
    file format (files ending with .gw). Written by Yann Corno. English
    version only.
  - [20 Sep 00] Added another page (gwsetup.htm) to explain how to use
    gwsetup. Added two paragraphs in a FAQ, in the beginning of the section
    "it does not work at all under windows", explaining not to delete the
    gwsetup window!
  - [07 Sep 00] In the directions for use, the entry "How to start with
    GeneWeb" now points to a page which explains that you can start with
    the program gwsetup instead of typing interactive commands, which seemed
    not to be clear. Changed diruse.htm (link to "start"), added initial.htm,
    added small paragraph in start.htm. Added also a paragraph in
    recover.htm, merge.htm and maint.htm.
  - [03 Sep 00] In FAQ, changed the text about the question of missing
    relationship links.
  - Added entries in the FAQ about:
    * [27 Sep 00] the message "probable loop in the data base",
    * [08 Sep 00] the research by place/surname, where only one person
      by surname is displayed,
    * [03 Sep 00] the fact that sometimes, under Windows, it does not
      work at all,
    * [01 Sep 00] the fact that information in forms sometimes disappear,
    * [01 Sep 00] adding more information in family forms,
    * [31 Aug 00] short dates displaying conventions,
    * [31 Aug 00] repetition of Sosa numbers for ancestors lists,
    * [29 Aug 00] advanced request,
    * [21 Aug 00] people having "?" (question mark) as first name and/or
      surname.

GeneWeb version 3.07
--------------------

* New feature
  - [18 Aug 00] Added a program "gwtp" (CGI) to upload and download GeneWeb
    data bases in a site which accomodate some (undocumented program for the
    moment).

* Distribution
  - [18 Aug 00] Create files named README.htm and LISEZMOI.htm instead
    of README.txt and LISEZMOI.txt.

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [16 Aug 00] In personal pages, does not display the age at death
    if less than one year and undefined month/day (it displayed "age at
    death: birth"!)
  - [14 Aug 00] In personal pages, sources are now printed, even for
    non friends, non wizards.
  - [11 Aug 00] In first names by alphabetic order for a given surname, now
    always specify the parents' names.
  - [09 Aug 00] Fixed a problem of missing space after "married to" in
    descendants page (did not happen with all browsers).
  - [30 Jul 00] Added an option "-conn_tmout" (available only under
    Unix) to specify a connection timeout for one request. If the request
    has not terminated after this time, it is killed. Default is 120s.
  - [30 Jul 00] Contribution from Ludovic Ledieu: changed displaying
    of ancestors trees: 1/ clicks on persons fall on their personal pages
    (no more for navigation) 2/ vertical bars are clickable to navigate 3/
    no more bars for missing ancestors.
  - [28 Jul 00] Fixed problem in images displaying in personal pages
    and in trees. Sometimes the image was "broken", its URL being
    incorrect. Details:
    * This happened in case of local image (field "image" filled in "person"
      form), and when the type was not among the recognized types
      (i.e. presently "gif", "jpeg", "png"): in these conditions, the URL
      for the image was incorrect.
    * The fix is not completely satisfactory: this kind of image is now no
      more displayed at all. Indeed, "gwd" need to know its type to answer
      the browser request (the HTTP answer must contain the image type).
    * A solution if there are images with other types than the ones that
      "gwd" recognizes, is to use the variable "images_path" in the data
      base configuration file (base.gwf). See the changes version 3.05 or
      the distributed example file "gw/etc/a.gwf".
  - [26 Jul 00] Added small icon in personal page to indicate sex
    (Louis Granboulan's idea)
  - [19 Jul 00] Fixed bug in places/surnames displaying: some identical
    places and surnames could be displayed several times.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [09 Aug 00] Added a consistency check: in some gedcoms (from bad
    genealogy softwares), it happens that a person can be noticed as
    "spouse" (FAMS) of a family without being however neither husband
    (HUSB) nor wife (WIFE) in that family. In the GeneWeb data base, the
    symptom was that the pages concerning this "spouse" (particularly
    his/her personal page) stopped in the middle. Now the converter
    displays an error message and fixes this inconsistency in the created
    data base.
  - [28 Jul 00] Fixed bug: when a person was married several times,
    the order of families were sometimes incorrect. Actually, the order
    wrongly followed the order where the families appeared in the
    gedcom, not the order indicated in the individual record.
  - [26 Jul 00] Added a lock to the data base before writing it (to avoid
    multiple accesses which risk to damage it).

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [28 Jul 00] Changed the behavior of the variable "body_prop" making
    the difference between 1/ not defined and 2/ defined as an empty string.
    In the first case, the default is assumed (i.e. GeneWeb's default
    background), in the second case, nothing is added in the <body>
    tag. This implies changes in programs "gwd" and "gwsetup".

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt) and welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  - [21 Jul 00] In lexicon: added the terms "Sosa"; changed "list" into
    "list/list (ancestors)" (specially for better translation in Swedish)
  - [18 Jul 00] Fixed Esperanto version (Thomas Ailleret).

* Documentation:
  - [16 Aug 00] Added an entry in the FAQ about the displaying of ages
    of persons of more than 80 years old.
  - [21 Jul 00] Documentation updates in Swedish (Lars Gustavsson)

GeneWeb version 3.06
--------------------

* Languages
  - [20 Jun 00] Added Latvian (Janeks Kamerovskis).

* Setup program (gwsetup)
  - [20 Jun 00] Added Latvian version (Janeks Kamerovskis).

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [04 Jul 00] Put all statitics in a different page (accessible only
    to "wizards" and "friends").
  - [04 Jul 00] Added the computation of the persons who lived the longest.
  - [27 Jun 00] When typing a name holding a number, searches also with
    its equivalent in Roman digits (e.g. it is possible to type "Louis 15"
    to find "Louis XV").
  - [26 Jun 00] Fixed bug: the images in ".png" format were not accepted.
  - [23 Jun 00] Added descendants displaying with d'Aboville's encoding.
  - [21 Jun 00] Added displaying of oldest perhaps still alive (from welcome
    page).
  - [20 Jun 00] Changed displaying of marriage witnesses in personal pages.
  - [20 Jun 00] Together with the link to the welcome page (up arrow), added
    a link to the referer page (left arrow).
  - [19 Jun 00] Changed page design of relationship computing.
  - [19 Jun 00] In latest marriages, display now only true marriages (i.e.
    not "relations" nor "engagements").
  - [18 Jun 00] Added a link in bottom of welcome pages, useful if you
    have got a browser which does not automatically update the modified
    pages (forcing you to do "reload current document"). When clicking on
    it, you browse without this problem: no more need to reload the pages,
    they are displayed with their changes if there are some.
  - [18 Jun 00] Fixed little problem: the (new) fast merges of persons did not
    appear in the history.
  - [17 Jun 00] In update family forms, added a button close to the "family
    source": when selected, the "family source" text is automatically put 
    (as default value) in "family source" fields in future other family
    updates. It avoids to have to copy it each time when it is always the
    same one.
  - [16 Jun 00] Added feature: in relationship computing, when option
    "shortest path" is selected, it is displayed together with a link
    to see the next shortest path.
  - [13 Jun 00] Deleted this stupid "<meta http-equiv...>" in welcome pages
    and in other pages, because it makes some browsers generate two requests
    and we see the page blinking. Moreover, it has no sense (even if it is
    standard), since the HTTP header already contains that.

* General
  - [26 Jun 00] In programs ged2gwb (gedcom import), gwb2ged (gedcom export),
    consang (consanguinity initialization) and gwu (uncompiler), added an
    error message in case of several input files are given (these programs can
    treat only one file at a time).

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc) and uncompiler (gwu)
  - [29 Jun 00] Fixed problem: persons with "relations" (e.g. adoptive
    children) where not saved (gwu) nor restored (gwc) when isolated
    (i.e. without parents nor marriages).

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [17 Jun 00] By default now, the "can_send_image" is "yes", meaning that
    if you specify nothing, the "send image" is proposed in update pages. To
    unset it, you must now specify: can_send_image=no

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt) and welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  - [20 Jun 00] Added entry !language for the translation of languages names
    in all languages. Used as labels associated with the flags of welcome
    pages.
  - [14 Jun 00] Completed and fixed Portuguese version (Jose Paulo Moitinho
    de Almeida).
  - [14 Jun 00] Completed Dutch lexicon (Bernard Ceurstemont).

* Documentation
  - [26 Jun 00] In update.htm, added that images in png format are accepted,
    like "gif" and "jpeg" ones.

GeneWeb version 3.05
--------------------

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [03 Jun 00] In history, added an input field before the ">>" to be able
    to specify a number of entries to be displayed in the next page.
  - [02 Jun 00] Merge of individuals faster now: can automatically merge
    families and individuals when they are identical in both ancestors trees.
  - [23 May 00] In "divorce" section, added case "separated".
  - [18 May 00] In displaying by places/surnames, baptism places are added
    with birth places and burial with death.
  - [17 May 00] Added an "Ok" button after the password input area
    in CGI mode.
  - [14 May 00] Added case "engaged" in "family" forms.
  - [14 May 00] Added option "-images_url" to give an URL to GeneWeb
    images (flags, logo, background, up arrow). Can be useful e.g. in
    cgi mode if the associated Web server answers faster than gwd. By
    default, the GeneWeb images are sent by gwd.
  - [14 May 00] Fixed bug in update forms (person or family): in case of
    name conflict (name already used by another person), when clicking on
    the "return" button, the fields containing quotes ("), less (<) or
    greater (>) characters were truncated.
  - [12 May 00] In short dates (just year), if no death date, burial date
    is now displayed. And in pages displaying the ages at death, take now the
    baptism date if no birth date and the burial date if no death date to
    compute this age (then prefixed by "possibly")
  - [10 May 00] In personal pages, the links "ancestors" and "descendants"
    are proposed from 2 generations (instead of 3, before).
  - [06..11 May 00] Added surname list from "ancestors" page.
  - [02 May 00] [technical] In Unix version now, each request gets the
    user id and the group id of the owner of the data base directory
    (base.gwb). No error if cannot change to these ids. Deleted the gwd
    options -setuid and -setgid now unuseful.
  - [30 Apr 00] Fixed little problem with displaying by places for the ones
    containing several (at least two) indications between parentheses.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb) and GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [25 May 00] Now save and restore the marriage witnesses (that was
    missing).

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [04 Jun 00] Fixed bug: did not save the information "not married" when
    no date specified. (Note: in GeneWeb, since there is no GEDCOM standard
    for that, the information "not married" is written as "unmarried" in the
    marriage place.)

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [03 Jun 00] Added variable "propose_add_family" (default yes). If yes,
    propose to wizards a "add family" link in welcome page. If no, not
    proposed.
  - [25 May 00] Added variable "images_path" to specify a path to access
    the images defined in the "image" field (i.e *not* added by "send image").
    Applies only for images not found in the image/base directory. This
    variable, when set, could typically start with http://...
  - [08 May 00] (detail) The possible trailing spaces or control-m are
    now stripped (allowing to move a base.gwf file from Windows to
    Unix without needing to remove them).

* Counters (cnt/base.txt)
  - [28 May 00] Now, a count of "wizard", "friend" and normal accesses
    are added in this file, for statistics.

* Documentation
  - [31 May 00, 06 Jun 00] Added paragraph explaining how to install GeneWeb
    in server mode under Windows NT (Falko Trojahn). English and German
    versions by Falko Trojahn. Swedish translation by Lars Gustavsson.
    French translation by Daniel de Rauglaudre.
  - [25 May 00] Updated German documentation (Falko Trojahn).
  - [06 May 00] Updated Swedish documentation (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [04 May 00] Added one item in FAQ about a possible problem in CGI mode.

GeneWeb version 3.04
--------------------

* Languages
  - [06 Apr 00] Added Afrikaans (Louis Kruger).

* Setup program (gwsetup)
  - [09 Apr 00] Fixed some bugs in Linux rpm package causing gwsetup to
    fail and the browser to answer "no output".

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [29 Apr 00] Fixed bug in "descendants", "families with encoding": the
    marriage dates of grandchildren could sometime be erroneously the ones
    of the children.
  - [16 Apr 00] Fixed problem: the kde browser (Konqueror) seems not to handle
    the password protocol. Went around the problem by treating it as it were
    in CGI mode, where the password has to be given in a form.
  - [14 Apr 00] Fixed bug: could no more access a person by his key after
    having changed his name, in the case when the initial first name or
    surname was a question marks *and* the changed name had nevertheless
    the same signature.
    Example:
       before: first name = "John Smith"; surname = "?"
        after: first name = "John"; surname = "Smith"
    When doing this fix, there were no more way to access "John Smith" by
    his key, particularly in forms (which is rather annoying).
  - [13 Apr 00] Added nice display of language code when mouse over the
    flag (Emmanuelle Visseaux's code).
  - [11 Aor 00] Added optional displaying of images in descendants by tree
    and in relationship trees.
  - [03 Apr 00] In ancestor page, added horizontal displaying.
  - [02 Apr 00] In surname page, added ability to click on a branch number
    to display only that one.
  - [27 Mar, 05 Apr 00] Added displaying of places/surnames from welcome page.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [11 Apr 00] Fixed bug+problem of adoptive children when they are also
    recorded as normal children of their adoptive parents in the GEDCOM
    (extracted from a genealogical software having a different logic than
    GeneWeb about this subject). The "bug" made the adoptive links not
    appear, the "problem" made the parents family not appear.
  - [31 Mar 00] Do not enter any more GIVN as public name if equal to first
    name nor SURN as surname alias if equal to surname.

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu) and GeneWeb to gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [04 Apr 00] Added option "-nn" not to save data base notes.

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [31 Mar 00] Added variable "places_inverted" (default no) to specify that
    places are ordered more-general-less-general (e.g. "USA, New York"
    instead of "New York, USA"). Important to specify correcty this variable
    for the new displaying by places/surnames.

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt)
  - [26 Apr 00] Changed "death age" into "age at death", "maybe" into
    "possibly" and "degre" into "degree".

* Documentation
  - [20 Apr 00] Changed the title of the chapter "How to install GeneWeb as a
    server" into "How to install GeneWeb as a server or CGI" (English and
    French versions).
  - [20 Apr 00] Changed the chapter "How to customize the welcome page".
    The title becomes "How to customize the welcome page and the other pages"
    A section "Customization of all the pages" has been inserted at end
    (English and French versions).
  - [20 Apr 00] Added the French version of the chapter "Keeping data
    divided inside a database".

GeneWeb version 3.03
--------------------

* Languages
  - [23 Jan 00] Added Russian (Konstantin Abakumov).

* Setup program (gwsetup)
  - [07 Feb 00] Changed some Swedish files (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [27 Jan 00; 03 Feb 00] Added a comment in the introduction text
    telling not to delete the window! (English, French, Swedish versions)

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [17 Mar 00] In CGI mode, the passwords are no more visible in the URL.
    Technical explanation: it works with a generated random login password
    with a timeout of 1800 seconds (half an hour), i.e. if you do nothing
    during half an hour, the login password is unactivated; this limit time is
    changeable by a new gwd option "-login_tmout". Note: this system does
    not use cookies.
  - [12 Mar 00] In ancestors page, added male and female lines.
  - [11 Mar 00] In personal pages, the images defined by external URL (i.e.
    accomodated in other Web sites) are now reduced as are local images.
  - [11 Mar 00] The information "relationship to" is no more transformed
    into "married to" when "non-friend" browsing (it was supposed to protect
    private life, but seems to have more drawbacks than advantages).
  - [09..10 Mar 00] In update family form, added ability to specify birth
    place, death date and death place for parents and children.
  - [08 Mar 00] Added latest marriages (accessible only by "wizards" and
    "friends")
  - [08 Mar 00] Added optional displaying of images in ancestors displaying
    by tree.
  - [05 Mar 00] In birthday anniversaries for close parents (accessible
    in "cousin" page for "friends" and "wizards"), the links give now the
    relationship trees, instead of the persons.
  - [04 Mar 00] In person and family forms, added input area to specify
    a number greater than 1 of titles and children to insert.
  - [24 Feb 00] In latest births and deaths pages, display monthes.
  - [02 Feb 00] In personal pages, relations are now displayed before notes.
  - [20 Jan 00] When sorting the children, use now the baptism date
    when there is no birth date.
  - [18 Jan 00] Fixed bug: when selecting no data base, the default page
    asks for a data base name, but in CGI mode when entering a data base,
    it did not work (incorrect URL).

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [19 Feb 00] Added option "-uin" (untreated in notes) asking to put
    unused Gedcom tags (of indiduals) in notes.

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [24 Feb 00] Added variable "latest_event" to give the number of latest
    events (births, deaths) displayed (default: 20).
  - [25 Jan 00] Added variable "public_if_titles": if "yes", consider persons
    having nobility titles as public ("public" means that their private data
    is displayed even if their dates is less than 150 years). Warning: the
    default of this variable is "no": it is a behavior change in GeneWeb,
    relatively to previous versions (but don't worry: with this change, 
    private data is better protected).

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt) and welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  - [10 Mar 00] Changed some Finnish translations (Antti Alfthan)
  - [14 Feb 00] Changed the term "place" of nobility titles into "estate"
    ("domaine" in French), to avoid the confusion with the "place" of
    "birth", "death", and so on. Changed also "all the places" into
    "all the estates".
  - [01 Feb 00] Fixed some Swedish translations (Lars Gustavsson)
  - [26 Jan 00] Fixed several Portuguese translations (Jose Paulo Moitinho
    de Almeida).
  - [21 Jan 00] Changed the English displaying of dates into "day month
    year", the displaying "month day year" being specific to the United
    States and not used in other English speaking countries. American
    users are invited to change the lexicon line for (date) if they
    want an American display.    

* Documentation
  - [17..25 Feb 00] Added a new chapter "Keeping data divided inside a
    database" (written by Lars Gustavsson: thanks, Lars!). Only
    English and Swedish versions for the moment.
  - [11 Feb 00] Changed some Swedish files (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [03 Feb 00] In chapter "modifications" (update.htm), section 1,
    added a footnote to explain that it is better to use western Europe
    languages encoding (iso-8859-1) for a person's "key".

GeneWeb version 3.02
--------------------

* Setup program (gwsetup)

    in "cousin" page when wizard or friend).
  - [Dec 26, 99] Added the ability to add a file "foo.hed" for the base

  - [Dec 15, 99] Added things to be able to translate correctly the
    noun complement ("x of y") in Finnish which sucks in the present
    version.
  - [Dec 14, 99] In relationship links with option "by marriage" does not
    display the consanguinity (0%) any more if all relations found are by
    marriage.

    were missing).
  - [Dec 13, 99] In tree displays with several branches, add the spouse(s)
    of the top person(s).
  - [Dec 13, 99] Fixed bug: when merging two persons, the godchildren,

    person were not transferred to the first person (problem only
    with "children" relations, not "parents").
  - [Dec 10, 99] In tree displays with several branches, the option
    "add spouses" did not work. Fixed.

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)

--------------------

New look for GeneWeb! Icon, default background, new structures of pages.
Thanks to Emmanuelle Visseaux.

* Languages
  - [Oct 26, 99] Added Icelandic (Ólafur Sigurgeirsson).

* Setup program (gwsetup)
  - [Oct 28, 99] Added option -p to select another port number (defaut: 2316).

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [Oct 24, 99] In display by surname, added a specific indication for
    the branches whose ancestor has parents with a different surname, in order
    to differentiate them with the branches whose ancestor has no parents.
  - [Oct 21, 99] Added message "or Sosa number relative to x" when displaying
    a relationship computing form if navigating with x as Sosa reference.
  - [Oct 21, 99] Limit local images height to some maximum number of pixels
    (currently 240). Not applied to distant (http://) images.
  - [Oct 21, 99] Fixed bug: there was no automatic "wizard" (resp. "friend")
    access in cgi mode when no "wizard" (resp. "friend") password was defined.
  - [Oct 20, 99] Added option -a to give a specific IP address for the
    service (must be compatible with the computer).
  - [Oct 19, 99] Added treatment of png images files.
  - [Oct 10, 99] In update form, when name conflict, added the birth and
    death date in the list of persons having the same name.
  - [Oct 8, 99] Added forum.
  - [Oct 5, 99] Fixed links problems in some pages from the DOC
    link (some problems found in the Swedish version).
  - [Oct 5, 99] Added displaying of number of persons in ascends (short
    display).
  - [Oct 4, 99] Fixed displaying bug in update history (spot displayed due
    to incorrect HTML).
  - [Oct 3, 99] Added week day in "calendars" page.

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Oct 26, 99] Added option -f, like in ged2gwb: by default now, if the data
    base already exists, the program exits in error. If option -f is used
    the old data base is overwritten.

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)
  - [Oct 24, 99] Added option -s to select all persons having a given surname
    (option usable several times). Added associated option -nsp, not to select
    the spouses' parents (what is done by default). These options has been
    added in command gwb2ged too.
  - [Oct 19, 99] Fixed bug: notes sometimes disappeared for godparents and co.
  - [Oct 10, 99] Fixed bug: dates represented as text where not extracted
    in the output file but on standard output.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Oct 13, 99] Added option "-fne" (for "first names enclosed"): it is
    possible to give two characters telling that the usual first name parts
    is between those characters: e.g. if they are of the form:
       Bernard Jean "Philippe"
    use -fne '""' and if they are:
       Bernard Jean (Philippe)
    use -fne '()', and so on.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [Oct 24, 99] Added option -s to select all persons having a given surname
    (option usable several times). Added associated option -nsp, not to select
    the spouses' parents (what is done by default). These options has been
    added in command gwu too.
  - [Oct 5, 99] Changed the way the lines of notes are cut (by tag CONC).
    The standard GEDCOM 5.5 tells that too long lines must be cut *inside*
    words and not *between* words, to avoid starting or trailing spaces in
    CONC lines. Gwb2ged did not do that: it is fixed.
    To remain compatible with old GEDCOMS generated by GeneWeb, the ged2gwb
    program is not changed: in CONC lines, the possible starting space remains
    included in the note (what does not respect the standard, shame on
    me).

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [Oct 30, 99] Deleted variable "enclosing_tag" defined in version 2.05
    on July 18, 99. Reason: complicated the code => too many risks of operation
    bugs. Sorry for the ones who used it.
  - [Oct 29, 99] Added a variable "propose_titles" (yes by default). When
    set to "no", the search by (nobility) titles is not proposed in the
    welcome page.

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt) and welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  - [Oct 31, 99] [technical point] Changed the conditional macros in
    the welcome pages, now between %I and %E.
  - [Oct 26, 99] Changed several Portuguese translations (Oscar Filipe de
    Oliveira Barroso).
  - [Oct 12, 99] Fixed and completed some Norwegian phrases (Brynjulf
    Langballe).
  - [Oct 4..10, 99] Fixed and completed some Dutch phrases (Joris Esch).
  - [Oct 4, 99] Fixed some German phrases (Falko Trojahn).

* Documentation
  - [Oct 31, 99] [technical point] Updated the documentation of the macros
    of the welcome page. Chapter "customization of pages", section "macros".

GeneWeb version 2.07

  - [Sep 16, 99] Distribute different versions of the introduction text
    for Windows and Unix (problems of accents). (Does not concern
    the Linux distribution by rpm package.)
  - [Sep 13, 99] Added German version (Thomas Omerzu).
  - [Sep 9, 99] Added Swedish version (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Sep 8, 99] Fixed lot of typos and errors in English version
    (thanks to Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Sep 6, 99] Fixed problem in Windows: if the user choosed a
    language by writing it in uppercase letters, some phrases where
    displayed in English language between brackets (no matter which
    language was selected), indicating that the language was not found
    in the lexicon.

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [Oct 1, 99] Fixed bug: the pages from the "DOC" link were
    sometimes not correctly displayed with certain browsers (HTTP headers

  - [Sep 23, 99] Added witnesses for marriages.
  - [Sep 22, 99] Fixed bug: bad display of "nth cousin" in Swedish (due
    to problems with the character ":" in the translation).

  - [Sep 21, 99] Added "CREDITS" in doc, accessible from the "DOC" link too.
  - [Sep 20, 99] Changed gif files (flags and up arrow) into jpeg files.
  - [Sep 19, 99] In "search", can find someone if only one of his first
    names is given: e.g. can find "Marie Liesse de Rohan Chabot" if searching
    "Marie de Rohan Chabot" or "Liesse de Rohan Chabot". Works partially,
    i.e. only if the classic search failed.
  - [Sep 17, 99] Can use now special characters for wizard/friend passwords
    in CGI mode (before, it worked only in service mode).
  - [Sep 16, 99] Advanced search with baptism date and place did not work:
    fixed.
  - [Sep 16, 99] Changed the order of dates in modifications forms into:
    year/month/day and these fields are now labelled.
  - [Sep 15..27, 99] Added calendars for dates (Gregorian, Julian, French
    Republic, Hebrew).
  - [Sep 11..17, 99] Now, several users and passwords can be defined for
    "wizard" and "friend" access, by specifying authorization file names in
    the "base.gwf" file.
  - [Sep 8, 99] Fixed bug: in descendant displaying, if the person has
    quotes in his name, the displaying was sometimes wrong.
  - [Sep 8, 99] In "DOC" links, in the bottom of the pages, the links
    with Email addresses did not work correctly. Fixed.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Sep 28, 99] By default now, if a data base with the same name already
    exists, does not erase it and exits in error. Added option -f to
    overwrite the old version.

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [Sep 17..19, 99] Run faster when no modifications have been done (e.g. just
    after the creation of the data base).

  - [Sep 22, 99] Fixed some German phrases (Gerriet Backer).

* Documentation
  - [Sep 10, 99] Updated Swedish files (Lars Gustavsson).

    and LISEZMOI.txt (French), added a few lines of explanations for starting
    with GeneWeb.
  - [Jul 15, 99] Changed internal representation of strings in data bases.
    Should not make any differences while browsing. However, as it is a major
    internal change in the program, problems may appear (mainly in displaying
    or in access by name, first name, surname, title...): please report if any
    problem.

* Setup program
  - [Jul 18, 99] Added in the menu "data base parameters" the ability to
    display the characters in the pages 1/ in bold, 2/ in italic, 3/ in
    smaller or bigger size (using the new key 'enclosing_tag': see below
    section "base configuration files"). Bold is useful, for example, if
    a background image is used, to make the text more readable. [Spanish
    version not yet translated]
  - [Jul 15, 99] Changed GEDCOM export menu to reflect new option "-charset"
    of "gwb2ged" (see below in section "GeneWeb to Gedcom").
  - [Jul 2, 99] Fixed bug: importing GeneWeb base from old version passing
    by a GEDCOM file did not work if the current directory held spaces.
  - [Jul 2, 99] Changed names of html files to hold 8 characters maximum
    and 3 characters for the extension, to be unzippable by "pkunzip".

    from "modify".
  - [Aug 6, 99] Restored the system of robot exclusion (had been deleted
    in version 1.10) with some improvements. Option "-robot_xcl".
  - [Aug 5, 99] Added descendants displaying by tree (doesn't work with Lynx).

  - [Aug 3, 99] In relationship by branches, found a solution to
    display the vertical bars correctly aligned relative to the
    horizontal bars (works at least with Netscape, IE, Kfm).
  - [Aug 2, 99] In relationship displaying, can make the difference in
    the lexicon between father's and mother's side (used in Swedish, where
    there are different words for "uncle", "aunt", "great-uncle" and
    "great-aunt" depending on they are on father's or mother's side).
  - [Aug 1, 99] Added relationships computing by marriage.
  - [Jul 28, 99] In "cousins" pages, added link to uncles and aunts, nephews
    and nieces.
  - [Jul 26..28, 99] Added other relations: godparents, adoptive parents,
    recognizing parents, candidate parents.
  - [Jul 22, 99] In relationship branches displaying, when the spouses are
    displayed, display also the marriage date.
  - [Jul 20, 99] In the titles displaying, sort preferably the persons by
    the nth rank (e.g. "nth duke of ...") when existing.
  - [Jul 19, 99] Fixed bug in descendants by list: displaying was incorrect
    when several marriages and one of them with an unknown ("? ?") person.
  - [Jul 18, 99] When updating families, the "sources" field is propagated
    into the created persons.
  - [Jul 18, 99] Fixed small bug for the access by subparts of surnames
    (it sometimes accepted too small subparts: then the "search" could
    give weird results).
  - [Jul 17, 99] In welcome page, now search by surname when search by
    full name fails (no need to select "surname"). Idem in relationship
    computing.
  - [Jul 17, 99] Fixed bug: could not access person after having changed his
    name, in some circumstances, e.g. changing the surname "L'epine" (in
    two words) into "Lepine" (one word).
  - [Jul 16, 99] Added a "back" button in case of update error (useful
    for browsers which loose the contents of the forms when navigating).

    the ability to see the spouses in branches displaying, and the ability
    to cancel GeneWeb links.

    Esperanto, Czech). Changed the lexicon to use this new system.
  - [Jul 9, 99] Added link (upper arrow) to welcome page in displayings by
    first names and surnames.
  - [Jul 9, 99] Fixed date check for possible father when interval (i.e. was
    telling "incorrect" when father died between 1250 and 1260 and son born
    in 1255).
  - [Jul 3, 99] Added "af" as possible surnames particles (this is Danish)
    possibly ignored in "search".

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Jul 5, 99] Fixed bug sometimes stopping the program (exception
    "Invalid_argument") after the detection of an error of a family whose
    parents are of bad sex (female father and male mother).
  - [Jul 2, 99] Recognizes the dates of the form "FROM..TO..".

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [Jul 15, 99] Added option "-charset" whose values can be "ANSEL" or
    "ASCII": "ASCII" is the default. Deleted option "-ascii" now unuseful.
  - [Jul 2, 99] Generate now dates of the form "FROM..TO.." for titles.

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [Jul 18, 99] Added the key 'enclosing_tag' to enclose whole displayed

    text is displayed bold. Added comment about that in the template file
    "a.gwf".

GeneWeb version 2.04
--------------------

* Setup program
  - [Jun 28, 99] Fixed bug: did not work for directories holding spaces.
  - [Jun 19, 99] Changed GEDCOM import menu to reflect new option "-charset"
    of "ged2gwb" (see below in section "Gedcom to GeneWeb").
  - [Jun 18, 99] Added a color combination in the provided palette
    whiteyellow, black, bluegreen and brown (thanks to Hans Albeck)

* GeneWeb Daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Jun 30, 99] Added the ability to enter a Sosa number in the welcome page
    when navigating with someone as Sosa reference number (still available from
    its "ancestors" page).
  - [Jun 30, 99] In relationship links, display common ancestors in a more
    canonical order.
  - [Jun 28, 99] Due to optimization in consanguinity computing (see below),
    the answer time of relationship computing for persons without relationship
    links is generally faster (it answers: "no relationship links" faster).
  - [Jun 26, 99] Added the ability to access persons having composed surnames
    by subparts of their surname: e.g. "Josephine Tascher de La Pagerie" can
    now be found by typing just "Josephine Tascher" or "Josephine de La
    Pagerie".
  - [Jun 25, 99] Added short (horizontal) display for surnames by
    alphabetic order + ability to cancel GeneWeb links (for creation of
    static HTML pages).
  - [Jun 22, 99] Fixed bug: send image in CGI mode did not work.
  - [Jun 19..28, 99] Added in ancestors long display the ability to select
    and unselect the displaying of siblings and the displaying of notes.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Jun 21, 99] Fixed bug: couples could sometimes be recorded as divorced,
    even if not (when there was a "1 DIV" field without DATE and PLAC in the
    gedcom file).
  - [Jun 19, 99] Can now read MSDOS accentuated characters encoding. Added
    option "-charset" which can be followed by "ANSEL", "ASCII" or "MSDOS".
    Removed options "-ansel" and "-no_ansel".
    Warning: in GEDCOM files, the charset "IBMPC" (which is not standard
    GEDCOM 5.5) is by default interpreted as "ASCII", *not* "MSDOS"; to
    override this default, the option "-charset MSDOS" will have to be used.

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [Jun 28, 99] Optimized code: it is twice faster (on average) now.

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt)
  - [Jun 30, 99] Translations added in Italian (Daniel Hirshkoff).
  - [Jun 18..Jul 1, 99] Translations improvements in Danish (Hans Albeck).

GeneWeb version 2.03
--------------------

* Setup program
  - [Jun 7, 99] Added a Spanish version (Luis Castro Guzman).
  - [Jun 1, 99] The location to open is now always "http://localhost:2316/",
    independant from the selected language (no more need to end the location
    with "fr" or "en"): the page is displayed in the selected language.
  - [May 15, 99] Added deletion of ".gwo" file after then "gwc" operation.
  - [May 9, 99] Added predefined palette combination in "data base parameters";
    changed presentation of all page.

    did not work when the old directory held spaces.
  - [May 7, 99] Fixed bad behavior under Windows: "GWU.EXE" (in uppercase)
    was not regognized when searching for old GeneWeb versions.
  - [May 7, 99] Fixed bug: "cleanup" under Windows did not work.

* GeneWeb  aemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Jun 7, 99] No more (stupid) abbreviation for "Number" in update forms:
    Did not work for many languages.
  - [Jun 3, 99] Added ability to use a new predefined term "+before" in the
    lexicon to specify the complement is before a verb (e.g. in German:
    "send" "image" is translated into "senden +before" "Bild", which gives
    at end: "Bild senden"; same solution for Dutch).
  - [May 31, 99] In ancestors only selected generation, added displaying
    of Sosa intervals (and "..." is displayed for non-contiguous intervals).
  - [May 18, 99] Added, in ancestors and descendants displaying, the ability
    to cancel GeneWeb links. Useful to extract a Web page for a site without
    GeneWeb server.
  - [May 16, 99] Fixed bug: in ascendants long displaying, did not display
    the last possible generation.
  - [May 15, 99] Added a "?" at end of empty requests (with just the data base
    name) because of too smart browsers which automatically add a "/" at end
    of the address in this case (transforming e.g. "http://host/base" into
    "http://host/base/"), what makes the request not working.
  - [May 14, 99] Fixed bug: in personal pages, the term "died" was sometimes
    missing when there was only a death place but no death date. Happened
    for persons born more than 120 years ago.
  - [May 12, 99] Fixed problem in CGI mode under Windows: sometimes displayed
    warning texts on the page.
  - [May 11, 99] Fixed bug: advanced search worked bad when neither "wizard"
    nor "friend": did not work when only specifying e.g. a first name
    or a surname of an existing (non "public") person.
  - [May 11, 99] Fixed bug: when adding ";opt=no_index" in URLs like explained
    in the doc ("How to put links to your base"), the used language was
    missing in the new URL.
  - [May 10, 99] Added ability to put relationship date for non married
    persons.
  - [May 7, 99] Fixed bug visible in Danish: the AE ligature ("&aelig;")

    and Spanish welcome page (Luis Castro Guzman).

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [May 19, 99] Better catenation of continuation (CONC) notes. In particular
    fixes the bug which sometimes added spaces inside words.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [May 19, 99] Fold notes lines at 255 characters (required by GEDCOM
    standard) adding CONC.

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [May 23, 99] Does not restart from scratch when changes: compute
    only what's necessary.

* Documentation
  - [May 13..31, 99] Updated Swedish documentation (Lars Gustavsson).

GeneWeb Version 2.02
--------------------

* New feature

  - [May 4, 99] Added a new program "setup" which will allow to
    use a lot of commands without having to type magic incantations in a
    MSdos (Windows) or Xterm (Unix) window. Everything is done in the Web
    navigator: creation of a database, extraction of a GEDCOM file, cleanup,
    etc etc.
    Should be convenient for non computer scientists beginners (and even for
    old timers computer scientists who already know GeneWeb).

* General
  - [Apr 22, 99] Added Danish language (by Hans Albeck).

* GeneWeb Daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [May 6, 99] Fixed bad behavior: in "modify person" form, a person was

  - [May 4, 99] Added button "include missing spouses" for missing ancestors.
  - [May 4, 99] Suppressed trace log count in CGI mode in not redirected

    a first name for corresponding surnames starting with an accentuated
    letter.
  - [Apr 29, 99] Accept now files in image field ending with ".jpeg" and
    ".JPEG" (accepted before only with ".jpg" and ".JPG").
  - [Apr 29, 99] Fixed bug: when a persons first name, last name and number
    is the same as another person, GeneWeb shows a warning and suggests a new
    number. If the new number is selected, all special signs were
    transformed into codes.
  - [Apr 29, 99] Fixed small uncomfortable feature: when trying to save an
    image from a GeneWeb page, the browsers did not propose a correct file
    name to save this image (due to request syntax).
  - [Apr 29, 99] Added ability to change the first name and the surname
    of all children of a person in one only form. See new doc.
  - [Apr 26, 99] Fixed upload of "jpeg" files which sometimes did not work
    with Windows (message: "incorrect request")
  - [Apr 25, 99] Added space before "+" in short dates.

* Lexicon (lexicon.txt)
  - [Apr 23, 99] Some changes in Hebrew version (by Jonathan Marder).

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)

    point "add parents" to number 6), added section 5.8 for explanations.

GeneWeb Version 2.01
--------------------

* General
  - [Apr 2, 99] Added Norwegian language (Brynjulf Langballe).

* GeneWeb Daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Apr 20, 99] Changed suffix ".cnf" into ".gwf" for configuration files
    (because of confusion with that predefined suffix in Windows).
  - [Apr 20, 99] In short dates (just year), if no birth date, baptism date
    is displayed.
  - [Apr 19, 99] In latest births and latest deaths displaying, the
    dates with just the year or just the month and the year are also taken
    into account.
  - [Apr 17, 99] Improved relationship branches displaying to be readable
    with Lynx (terminal browser without tables).
  - [Apr 16, 99] When merging persons, the lowest number is proposed by
    default.
  - [Apr 16, 99] Added long display for ancestors.
  - [Apr 13, 99] Fixed bug in personal pages: for people having a public
    name, the (small) links to the first name and surname could work
    bad in case of accents. Fixed other bug same kind: in advanced
    request, research did not work if accents were used...
  - [Apr 6, 99] Fixed bug in personal pages, titles dates were sometimes
    displayed just as "...".
  - [Apr 2, 99] Fixed bug: in missing ancestors in alphabetic order, the
    accents in surnames were incorrectly displayed.

    cousins (from the "cousin" link in personal pages).
  - [Mar 25, 99] Added the "unmarried" case for couples.
  - [Mar 23, 99] Added display of number of accesses in traces.
  - [Mar 17, 99] In person modification form, determines whether a person
    is died or not (if not specified), according to his age.
  - [Mar 16-19, 99] The presence of images in pages does not block any
    more the display of the text. For example, in welcome pages, the text
    does not wait for the displaying of the flags to be displayed, which
    is much more comfortable. (This applies only for local images).
  - [Mar 14, 99] In anniversaries, in the list of months, the selected
    month is now the current month, not always January.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Apr 2, 99] Added the automatic computation that a person is died or
    not (if not indicated in the gedcom), according to the person's age,
    and deleted the option "-nd".
  - [Mar 31, 99] Added option "-log" to redirect output.

    numbers: -dates_dm when day before month and -dates_md when month
    before day.
  - [Mar 16, 99] Did not work for gedcom files with white spaces in the
    beginning of the lines. Fixed.
  - [Mar 11, 99] Fixed horrible bug: treatment of accents worked bad for
    gedcom files with ascii charset (resulting problems in "a" umlaut, for
    example).

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [Mar 26, 99] Added option -q for quiet mode, just displaying a progress
    bar.

* Lexicon (lexicon.txt) and Welcome files (xx/start.txt)
  - [Mar 10, 99] Some changes in Italian version (by Raffaele Sena).

    a person", paragraph "Death".

* Internal
  - [Mar 24, 99] (working Unix only) Added options "-setuid" and "-setgid"
    to "gwd" to change the user or group id after socket bind. This allows
    for example to use the port 80 (root needed) but accessing data as
    normal user.

GeneWeb Version 2.00
--------------------

From the version 2.00, the license is GPL (GNU General Public
License). The previous license still applies up to the version 1.11

    were often truncated.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)

    individuals, because it is often the case in Gedcom files. But this is
    not mandatory in definition Gedcom 5.5. Fixed.
  - [Feb 6, 99] Accept dates with "/" (20/11/1993) although it is not
    standard Gedcom 5.5. Interpreted as day/month/year.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [Feb 26, 99] Fixed error: the first name alias if any was always saved
    in the gedcom as first name. Now saved only as first name if it starts
    with the first name (e.g. if first name = "John" and first name alias =
    "John Philip Robert").

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Feb 19, 99] The option "-cg" did not work. Fixed.

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)

    visibility by password restriction).
  - [Jan 18, 99] In notes and sources, the string "%s" is replaced by the
    name of the base in the same context. For example, in a source field,
    if "John Smith" is in the same database, it is possible to record it
    as:
      <a href="%sp=john;n=smith">John Smith</a>
  - [Jan 11, 99] Display declined forms (for some languages). E.g.:
      * in German: "x ist ein Sohn von einem Cousin von y"
	  ("einem" instead of the inkorrect "ein").
      * in Esperanto: "aldoni personon"
          ("personon" instead of the incorrect "persono")

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Jan 26, 99] Fixed bug: failure when backslashes in source.
  - [Jan 18, 99] Fixed two bugs in dates parsing: 1. "x..y" (between x and

  - [Jan 19, 99] Fixed bug: the tag "<br>" was converted into a new line
    only in lowercase form; "<BR>" did not work.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb and GeneWeb to Gedcom (ged2gwb, gwb2ged)
  - [Jan 18, 99] When there are several names (several records "1 NAME") for
    someone in Gedcom, the other become "aliases" (and vice versa for
    gwb2ged).

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)
  - [Feb 4, 99] Notes for persons having "?" no more saved (these
    persons are supposed to be deadends and this made "gwc" fail).

* Lexicon file (lexicon.txt)
  - [Feb 3, 99] Some changes in Swedish translation (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Jan 28, 99] Added section "!dir" for languages written right to left.
  - [Jan 28, 99] [minor] Portuguese translation now in pure ascii using
    HTML "&" macros instead of accents (no changes in Portuguese displaying)

    for use", page "modifications", section 5.4 ("modify a person"),
    paragraph "Photo".

    directory name in this paragraph.
  - [Jan 22, 99] Added a few lines for "How to merge two families" in the
    page "modifications".
  - [Jan 20, 99] Added documentation for:

      * how to customize welcome pages.
  - [Jan 11, 99] Swedish version (Lars Gustavsson).

    were sometimes not found.
  - [08/01/99] Changed term "consanguinity" into "relationship" in
    relationship computing (because confusion with the usual meaning of
    the term "consanguinity").
  - [06/01/99] Deleted Unix option "-robot_xcl": worked bad, did not detect
    robots, detected robots when there are not, too complicated to fix.
    (The normal HTTP robot exclusion remains.)
  - [28/12/98] Changed some http requests to hold no accents (should be
    continued...)
  - [19/12/98] Fixed bug quotes disappearing in field "first name aliases"
    in form Update/Person (if the value holds quotes).
  - [18/12/98] No more HTML "table" used in relationship links with

    without tables, e.g. "lynx").
  - [13/12/98] The directory cnt is no more searched in the directory where
    the daemon (or the CGI) is launched but in the base directory (option -bd

GeneWeb Version 1.09
--------------------

* Inside databases
--- Precisions of dates now apply not only for years, but for complete
    date. E.g. "maybe on september 1815" or "after september 23, 1815".
--- In dates, added case "between": between year and another year.
  - Structure of databases have been changed for these two above points.
  - Area "comment" in families is now kept even if there are children.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - Delete of duplicated FAMS which sometimes happen in erroneous Gedcoms.
  - Delete families from GEDCOM when parents dont have the good sex.
  - Added displaying of line number when syntax errors and unrecognized dates.
  - Get sources if defined by pointer (but just the 1st line).
  - Added option "-no_nd" (no negative dates), not to interpret years preceded
    by a minus sign as negative dates.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - Added option "-ascii" to output in ASCII encoding instead of ANSEL.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb and GeneWeb to Gedcom (ged2gwb, gwb2ged)
  - The <em>GeneWeb</em> fields "public name", "surname alias" and
    "photo" are now loaded from and saved to Gedcom resp. as: "2 GIVN",
    "2 SURN" and "1 OBJE (newline) 2 FILE".

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
--- Added alibity to specify someone as Sosa reference. Then the Sosa
    number is printed in navigation when displaying ancestors. Thanks to
    Emmanuelle Visseaux for this idea.
--- Restructuration of displaying of surnames and first names by alphabetic
    order and frequency. Fixed bug of bad alphabetic order when first names
    and surnames with accents. Access in indexes faster.
  - In list by title places, added clickable "The whole list" giving the
    list of all persons associated with this place, whatever the title.
  - Descendants display limited to 12 generations in all cases (else too much
    text or too long to answer).
  - Added error message in relationship computing when loop in
    database (someone being his/her own ancestor).
  - In "search", added ability to write "I" instead of "Ier" (french form).
    Ex: "Charles I" or "Charles Ier" are both accepted.
  - Added ability to add ";opt=no_index" at end of requests to get an
    equivalent link independant from the persons' index number (useful
    to put direct links in Web pages).
  - Added text "Parents of" in top of pages of missing ancestors.
  - Fixed still several bugs (accents) due to new ANSEL encoding.

* Base configuration files (xxx.cnf)
  - Added variable "wizard_just_friend" to suspend the powers of
    "wizards" (e.g. for maintenance): when set to "yes", they become
    simple "friends" (default: "no").
  - Variable "renamed" can be used to specify that a database has been
    renamed. Generates a page giving the good URL to use.

* GeneWeb compiler and Consanguinity computing (gwc, consang)
  - Fixed accents displaying in traces and error messages.

* Welcome pages (start.txt)
  - Fixed wrong displaying of number of accesses in spanish (es) and
    portuguese (pt) versions.
  - Display thousand separators in numbers of accesses.

* Documentation (directory doc)
  - Added 2 cases in FAQ.
  - Many small changes.

GeneWeb Version 1.08
--------------------

* Added portuguese among languages (thanks to Yves Guignard).

* gwd:
  - fixed several displaying bugs due to ANSEL
  - in forms, when a precision (about, maybe, before, after, or year) is given
    for a date, the day and month part are ignored, since its works only for
    years (for the moment).
  - photos and background in directory "images" can be installed in a
    subdirectory having the name of the database; ex: "images/martin" for
    the database "martin".
  - display "+" for dead people even if not known date

* gwc, gwu:
  - added backslash as escape character for underscores

* gwc:
  - save much much memory space while running when there are many many notes

* ged2gwb:
  - fixed bug displaying "Uncaught exception: Stream.Error("get to eoln")" when
    the gedcom file did not end with a newline

  - display birthdays of persons with death "don't know" (but without age)

* ged2gwb:
  - does not stop any more when bad GEDCOM line found => warning and goes on.
  - added option -nd setting flag "not dead" instead of "don't know if dead"
    for personal records where "DEAT" exists but is empty.

* gwb2ged:
  - start now pointers with 1 instead of 0 because some softwares seem not
    to accept @I0@ and @F0@.
  - generate always ANSEL encoding

    versions of Windows 95, "gwd" started normally, but when opening
    the site in the navigator, the site was found but the navigator was
    waiting and waiting forever.
  - When updating a person, if the "notes" field holds only a newline,
    the request is rejected => fixed. Moreover some browsers add this "bad"
    newline if the notes fields is empty => fixed.

    between two persons by their names

  - fixed bug: date 16/2/1964 gave "year = 16" instead of "year = 1964"

* gwd, a.cnf, lang/lexicon.txt
  - deleted principle of "message" (was undocumented, anyway)

* gwd, doc:

GeneWeb Version 1.0
-------------------

CGI mode is Ok.

* gwd, ged2gwb, lang/lexicon.txt:
  - errors on dates become warnings

GeneWeb Version 1.0-beta.10
---------------------------

Still intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode.

* gwd:
  - fixed bug: update did not work in cgi mode.
  - print person link after "family switch"
  - when using "add parents", surname is printed in child area => ability
    to change father's.

GeneWeb Version 1.0 beta.9
--------------------------

Intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode under Windows NT.

* More documentation

* gwd:
  - cgi is detected by the presence of environment variable QUERY_STRING.
    It seems that .bat files is not accepted in Web servers in Windows NT,
    so one must use "gwd" itself.
  - if "gwd" is installed in cgi directory, and is renamed, e.g. "geneweb.exe",
    ability to add a file named "geneweb.arg" holding some lines
       * the first line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where "lang" is installed
       * the second line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where the databases are installed
       * the third line, if existing, may hold the string "cgi" telling
            that gwd must run on "cgi" mode, even if QUERY_STRING is
            not set
  - added option -bd: bases directory
  - no error message now if background not found

* Deleted "add/person" in update (gwd) and in welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  => impossibility now to directly create isolated persons. This is because
  it often leads to manipulation errors. To add a new baby, use "modify
  family" from one of his parents' personal record.
