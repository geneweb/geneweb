  - [Feb 6, 99] Accept dates with "/" (20/11/1993) although it is not
    standard Gedcom 5.5. Interpreted as day/month/year.

    name of the base in the same context. For example, in a source field,
    if "John Smith" is in the same database, it is possible to record it
    as:
      <a href="%sp=john;n=smith">John Smith</a>
  - [Jan 11, 99] Display declined forms (for some languages). E.g.:
      * in German: "x ist ein Sohn von einem Cousin von y"
	  ("einem" instead of the inkorrect "ein").
      * in Esperanto: "aldoni personon"
          ("personon" instead of the incorrect "persono")

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Jan 26, 99] Fixed bug: failure when backslashes in source.
  - [Jan 18, 99] Fixed two bugs in dates parsing: 1. "x..y" (between x and

  - [Jan 19, 99] Fixed bug: the tag "<br>" was converted into a new line
    only in lowercase form; "<BR>" did not work.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb and GeneWeb to Gedcom (ged2gwb, gwb2ged)
  - [Jan 18, 99] When there are several names (several records "1 NAME") for
    someone in Gedcom, the other become "aliases" (and vice versa for
    gwb2ged).

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)
  - [Feb 4, 99] Notes for persons having "?" no more saved (these
    persons are supposed to be deadends and this made "gwc" fail).

    relationship computing (because confusion with the usual meaning of
    the term "consanguinity").

    in form Update/Person (if the value holds quotes).
  - [18/12/98] No more HTML "table" used in relationship links with
    one branch (=> more compact display and visible in browsers
    without tables, e.g. "lynx").
  - [13/12/98] The directory cnt is no more searched in the directory where
    the daemon (or the CGI) is launched but in the base directory (option -bd
    of gwd; no difference if option -bd not used).

GeneWeb Version 1.09
--------------------

* Inside databases
--- Precisions of dates now apply not only for years, but for complete
    date. E.g. "maybe on september 1815" or "after september 23, 1815".
--- In dates, added case "between": between year and another year.
  - Structure of databases have been changed for these two above points.
  - Area "comment" in families is now kept even if there are children.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - Delete of duplicated FAMS which sometimes happen in erroneous Gedcoms.
  - Delete families from GEDCOM when parents dont have the good sex.
  - Added displaying of line number when syntax errors and unrecognized dates.
  - Get sources if defined by pointer (but just the 1st line).
  - Added option "-no_nd" (no negative dates), not to interpret years preceded
    by a minus sign as negative dates.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - Added option "-ascii" to output in ASCII encoding instead of ANSEL.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb and GeneWeb to Gedcom (ged2gwb, gwb2ged)
  - The <em>GeneWeb</em> fields "public name", "surname alias" and
    "photo" are now loaded from and saved to Gedcom resp. as: "2 GIVN",
    "2 SURN" and "1 OBJE (newline) 2 FILE".

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
--- Added alibity to specify someone as Sosa reference. Then the Sosa
    number is printed in navigation when displaying ancestors. Thanks to
    Emmanuelle Visseaux for this idea.
--- Restructuration of displaying of surnames and first names by alphabetic
    order and frequency. Fixed bug of bad alphabetic order when first names
    and surnames with accents. Access in indexes faster.
  - In list by title places, added clickable "The whole list" giving the
    list of all persons associated with this place, whatever the title.
  - Descendants display limited to 12 generations in all cases (else too much
    text or too long to answer).
  - Added error message in relationship computing when loop in
    database (someone being his/her own ancestor).
  - In "search", added ability to write "I" instead of "Ier" (french form).
    Ex: "Charles I" or "Charles Ier" are both accepted.
  - Added ability to add ";opt=no_index" at end of requests to get an
    equivalent link independant from the persons' index number (useful
    to put direct links in Web pages).
  - Added text "Parents of" in top of pages of missing ancestors.
  - Fixed still several bugs (accents) due to new ANSEL encoding.

* Base configuration files (xxx.cnf)
  - Added variable "wizard_just_friend" to suspend the powers of
    "wizards" (e.g. for maintenance): when set to "yes", they become
    simple "friends" (default: "no").
  - Variable "renamed" can be used to specify that a database has been
    renamed. Generates a page giving the good URL to use.

* GeneWeb compiler and Consanguinity computing (gwc, consang)
  - Fixed accents displaying in traces and error messages.

* Welcome pages (start.txt)
  - Fixed wrong displaying of number of accesses in spanish (es) and
    portuguese (pt) versions.
  - Display thousand separators in numbers of accesses.

* Documentation (directory doc)
  - Added 2 cases in FAQ.
  - Many small changes.

GeneWeb Version 1.08
--------------------

* Added portuguese among languages (thanks to Yves Guignard).

* gwd:
  - fixed several displaying bugs due to ANSEL
  - in forms, when a precision (about, maybe, before, after, or year) is given
    for a date, the day and month part are ignored, since its works only for
    years (for the moment).
  - photos and background in directory "images" can be installed in a
    subdirectory having the name of the database; ex: "images/martin" for
    the database "martin".
  - display "+" for dead people even if not known date

* gwc, gwu:
  - added backslash as escape character for underscores

* gwc:
  - save much much memory space while running when there are many many notes

* ged2gwb:
  - fixed bug displaying "Uncaught exception: Stream.Error("get to eoln")" when
    the gedcom file did not end with a newline

  - display birthdays of persons with death "don't know" (but without age)

* ged2gwb:
  - does not stop any more when bad GEDCOM line found => warning and goes on.
  - added option -nd setting flag "not dead" instead of "don't know if dead"
    for personal records where "DEAT" exists but is empty.

* gwb2ged:
  - start now pointers with 1 instead of 0 because some softwares seem not
    to accept @I0@ and @F0@.
  - generate always ANSEL encoding

* bug fixes:
  - Fixed a problem of blocking: the symptom was that, in some
    versions of Windows 95, "gwd" started normally, but when opening
    the site in the navigator, the site was found but the navigator was
    waiting and waiting forever.
  - When updating a person, if the "notes" field holds only a newline,
    the request is rejected => fixed. Moreover some browsers add this "bad"
    newline if the notes fields is empty => fixed.

  - added request m=R;p=..;n=..;p1=..;n1=.. displaying relationship
    between two persons by their names

* ged2gwb:
  - when converting a date with qualifier, if the date holds day or month,
    converts into: "ca Year". Ex: "AFT APR 1218" is read as "ABT 1218".
  - fixed bug: date 16/2/1964 gave "year = 16" instead of "year = 1964"

* gwd, a.cnf, lang/lexicon.txt
  - deleted principle of "message" (was undocumented, anyway)

* gwd, doc:
  - changed terminology "occurrence number" into just "number" (I realized
    that "occurrence" is mathematical jargon).

GeneWeb Version 1.0
-------------------

CGI mode is Ok.

* gwd, ged2gwb, lang/lexicon.txt:
  - errors on dates become warnings

GeneWeb Version 1.0-beta.10
---------------------------

Still intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode.

* gwd:
  - fixed bug: update did not work in cgi mode.
  - print person link after "family switch"
  - when using "add parents", surname is printed in child area => ability
    to change father's.

GeneWeb Version 1.0 beta.9
--------------------------

Intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode under Windows NT.

* More documentation

* gwd:
  - cgi is detected by the presence of environment variable QUERY_STRING.
    It seems that .bat files is not accepted in Web servers in Windows NT,
    so one must use "gwd" itself.
  - if "gwd" is installed in cgi directory, and is renamed, e.g. "geneweb.exe",
    ability to add a file named "geneweb.arg" holding some lines
       * the first line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where "lang" is installed
       * the second line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where the databases are installed
       * the third line, if existing, may hold the string "cgi" telling
            that gwd must run on "cgi" mode, even if QUERY_STRING is
            not set
  - added option -bd: bases directory
  - no error message now if background not found

* Deleted "add/person" in update (gwd) and in welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  => impossibility now to directly create isolated persons. This is because
  it often leads to manipulation errors. To add a new baby, use "modify
  family" from one of his parents' personal record.
