  - [Nov 10, 99] Added foster parents.
  - [Nov 10, 99] Changed structure of data bases for internal optimizations.

  - [Nov 5, 99] Accept roman digits in years of French Republican dates.

GeneWeb version 3.00
--------------------

New look for GeneWeb! Icon, default background, new structures of pages.
Thanks to Emmanuelle Visseaux.

* Languages
  - [Oct 26, 99] Added Icelandic (Ólafur Sigurgeirsson).

* Setup program (gwsetup)
  - [Oct 28, 99] Added option -p to select another port number (defaut: 2316).

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [Oct 24, 99] In display by surname, added a specific indication for
    the branches whose ancestor has parents with a different surname, in order
    to differentiate them with the branches whose ancestor has no parents.
  - [Oct 21, 99] Added message "or Sosa number relative to x" when displaying
    a relationship computing form if navigating with x as Sosa reference.
  - [Oct 21, 99] Limit local images height to some maximum number of pixels
    (currently 240). Not applied to distant (http://) images.
  - [Oct 21, 99] Fixed bug: there was no automatic "wizard" (resp. "friend")
    access in cgi mode when no "wizard" (resp. "friend") password was defined.
  - [Oct 20, 99] Added option -a to give a specific IP address for the
    service (must be compatible with the computer).
  - [Oct 19, 99] Added treatment of png images files.
  - [Oct 10, 99] In update form, when name conflict, added the birth and
    death date in the list of persons having the same name.
  - [Oct 8, 99] Added forum.
  - [Oct 5, 99] Fixed links problems in some pages from the DOC
    link (some problems found in the Swedish version).
  - [Oct 5, 99] Added displaying of number of persons in ascends (short
    display).
  - [Oct 4, 99] Fixed displaying bug in update history (spot displayed due
    to incorrect HTML).
  - [Oct 3, 99] Added week day in "calendars" page.

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Oct 26, 99] Added option -f, like in ged2gwb: by default now, if the data
    base already exists, the program exits in error. If option -f is used
    the old data base is overwritten.

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)
  - [Oct 24, 99] Added option -s to select all persons having a given surname
    (option usable several times). Added associated option -nsp, not to select
    the spouses' parents (what is done by default). These options has been
    added in command gwb2ged too.
  - [Oct 19, 99] Fixed bug: notes sometimes disappeared for godparents and co.
  - [Oct 10, 99] Fixed bug: dates represented as text where not extracted
    in the output file but on standard output.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Oct 13, 99] Added option "-fne" (for "first names enclosed"): it is
    possible to give two characters telling that the usual first name parts
    is between those characters: e.g. if they are of the form:
       Bernard Jean "Philippe"
    use -fne '""' and if they are:
       Bernard Jean (Philippe)
    use -fne '()', and so on.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [Oct 24, 99] Added option -s to select all persons having a given surname
    (option usable several times). Added associated option -nsp, not to select
    the spouses' parents (what is done by default). These options has been
    added in command gwu too.
  - [Oct 5, 99] Changed the way the lines of notes are cut (by tag CONC).
    The standard GEDCOM 5.5 tells that too long lines must be cut *inside*
    words and not *between* words, to avoid starting or trailing spaces in
    CONC lines. Gwb2ged did not do that: it is fixed.
    To remain compatible with old GEDCOMS generated by GeneWeb, the ged2gwb
    program is not changed: in CONC lines, the possible starting space remains
    included in the note (what does not respect the standard, shame on
    me).

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [Oct 30, 99] Deleted variable "enclosing_tag" defined in version 2.05
    on July 18, 99. Reason: complicated the code => too many risks of operation
    bugs. Sorry for the ones who used it.
  - [Oct 29, 99] Added a variable "propose_titles" (yes by default). When
    set to "no", the search by (nobility) titles is not proposed in the
    welcome page.

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt) and welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  - [Oct 31, 99] [technical point] Changed the conditional macros in
    the welcome pages, now between %I and %E.
  - [Oct 26, 99] Changed several Portuguese translations (Oscar Filipe de
    Oliveira Barroso).
  - [Oct 12, 99] Fixed and completed some Norwegian phrases (Brynjulf
    Langballe).
  - [Oct 4..10, 99] Fixed and completed some Dutch phrases (Joris Esch).
  - [Oct 4, 99] Fixed some German phrases (Falko Trojahn).

* Documentation
  - [Oct 31, 99] [technical point] Updated the documentation of the macros
    of the welcome page. Chapter "customization of pages", section "macros".

GeneWeb version 2.07
--------------------

* Setup program (gwsetup)
  - [Sep 16, 99] Distribute different versions of the introduction text
    for Windows and Unix (problems of accents). (Does not concern
    the Linux distribution by rpm package.)
  - [Sep 13, 99] Added German version (Thomas Omerzu).
  - [Sep 9, 99] Added Swedish version (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Sep 8, 99] Fixed lot of typos and errors in English version
    (thanks to Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Sep 6, 99] Fixed problem in Windows: if the user choosed a
    language by writing it in uppercase letters, some phrases where
    displayed in English language between brackets (no matter which
    language was selected), indicating that the language was not found
    in the lexicon.

* GeneWeb Service/CGI (gwd)
  - [Oct 1, 99] Fixed bug: the pages from the "DOC" link were
    sometimes not correctly displayed with certain browsers (HTTP headers
    were missing).
  - [Sep 24, 99] Added history for updates (option to be set in file base.gwf).
  - [Sep 23, 99] Added witnesses for marriages.
  - [Sep 22, 99] Fixed bug: bad display of "nth cousin" in Swedish (due
    to problems with the character ":" in the translation).
  - [Sep 21, 99] Fixed bug: the "DOC" link did not work in CGI mode.
  - [Sep 21, 99] Added "CREDITS" in doc, accessible from the "DOC" link too.
  - [Sep 20, 99] Changed gif files (flags and up arrow) into jpeg files.
  - [Sep 19, 99] In "search", can find someone if only one of his first
    names is given: e.g. can find "Marie Liesse de Rohan Chabot" if searching
    "Marie de Rohan Chabot" or "Liesse de Rohan Chabot". Works partially,
    i.e. only if the classic search failed.
  - [Sep 17, 99] Can use now special characters for wizard/friend passwords
    in CGI mode (before, it worked only in service mode).
  - [Sep 16, 99] Advanced search with baptism date and place did not work:
    fixed.
  - [Sep 16, 99] Changed the order of dates in modifications forms into:
    year/month/day and these fields are now labelled.
  - [Sep 15..27, 99] Added calendars for dates (Gregorian, Julian, French
    Republic, Hebrew).
  - [Sep 11..17, 99] Now, several users and passwords can be defined for
    "wizard" and "friend" access, by specifying authorization file names in
    the "base.gwf" file.
  - [Sep 8, 99] Fixed bug: in descendant displaying, if the person has
    quotes in his name, the displaying was sometimes wrong.
  - [Sep 8, 99] In "DOC" links, in the bottom of the pages, the links
    with Email addresses did not work correctly. Fixed.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Sep 28, 99] By default now, if a data base with the same name already
    exists, does not erase it and exits in error. Added option -f to
    overwrite the old version.

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [Sep 17..19, 99] Run faster when no modifications have been done (e.g. just
    after the creation of the data base).

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt)
  - [Sep 22, 99] Fixed some German phrases (Gerriet Backer).

* Documentation
  - [Sep 10, 99] Updated Swedish files (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Sep 7, 99] Fixed some typos in the "pcustom.htm" files (English,
    German and Swedish versions).

    work.
  - [Aug 13..21, 99] In notes, URLs and Email addresses are now clickable.
  - [Aug 13, 99] Added the ability to change the text of some pages:
    1/ for site address redirection (gwd new option "-redirect", see below),
    2/ for data base name change (gwf file field "renamed") and
    3/ detected robot exclusion (when option -robot_xcl has been set).
  - [Aug 13, 99] Fixed bug: when merging persons, the "other relations" where
    not included.

    automatically consider persons having titles as public.
  - [Aug 29, 99] Fixed bug on access with pointers (between '@' in the
    gedcom) resulting on bad errors detections.
  - [Aug 22, 99] The option "-no_efn" is now the default. Made the change
    in "setup" files too.

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [Aug 20, 99] Added new variables "max_anc_level" and "max_desc_level"
    to specify the maximum level of generations that can be displayed in
    ancestors and descendants displaying (default resp. 8 and 12 generations).
  - [Aug 18, 99] Added a new variable "auth_file" in data bases configuration
    files (files ending with ".gwf") overriding the possible authorization
    file set by option "-auth" of gwd. Therefore now, each data base can have
    its specific global restricted access. See the template file "a.gwf".

GeneWeb version 2.05
--------------------

* General
  - [Aug 4, 99] In the distribution main directory, files README.txt (English)
    and LISEZMOI.txt (French), added a few lines of explanations for starting
    with GeneWeb.
  - [Jul 15, 99] Changed internal representation of strings in data bases.
    Should not make any differences while browsing. However, as it is a major
    internal change in the program, problems may appear (mainly in displaying
    or in access by name, first name, surname, title...): please report if any
    problem.

* Setup program
  - [Jul 18, 99] Added in the menu "data base parameters" the ability to
    display the characters in the pages 1/ in bold, 2/ in italic, 3/ in
    smaller or bigger size (using the new key 'enclosing_tag': see below
    section "base configuration files"). Bold is useful, for example, if
    a background image is used, to make the text more readable. [Spanish
    version not yet translated]
  - [Jul 15, 99] Changed GEDCOM export menu to reflect new option "-charset"
    of "gwb2ged" (see below in section "GeneWeb to Gedcom").
  - [Jul 2, 99] Fixed bug: importing GeneWeb base from old version passing
    by a GEDCOM file did not work if the current directory held spaces.
  - [Jul 2, 99] Changed names of html files to hold 8 characters maximum
    and 3 characters for the extension, to be unzippable by "pkunzip".

* GeneWeb Daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Aug 6, 99] Changed order of menu in "update page": separated "delete"
    from "modify".
  - [Aug 6, 99] Restored the system of robot exclusion (had been deleted
    in version 1.10) with some improvements. Option "-robot_xcl".
  - [Aug 5, 99] Added descendants displaying by tree (doesn't work with Lynx).
  - [Aug 3, 99] Added ancestors displaying (and navigating) by tree.
  - [Aug 3, 99] In relationship by branches, found a solution to
    display the vertical bars correctly aligned relative to the
    horizontal bars (works at least with Netscape, IE, Kfm).
  - [Aug 2, 99] In relationship displaying, can make the difference in
    the lexicon between father's and mother's side (used in Swedish, where
    there are different words for "uncle", "aunt", "great-uncle" and
    "great-aunt" depending on they are on father's or mother's side).
  - [Aug 1, 99] Added relationships computing by marriage.
  - [Jul 28, 99] In "cousins" pages, added link to uncles and aunts, nephews
    and nieces.
  - [Jul 26..28, 99] Added other relations: godparents, adoptive parents,
    recognizing parents, candidate parents.
  - [Jul 22, 99] In relationship branches displaying, when the spouses are
    displayed, display also the marriage date.
  - [Jul 20, 99] In the titles displaying, sort preferably the persons by
    the nth rank (e.g. "nth duke of ...") when existing.
  - [Jul 19, 99] Fixed bug in descendants by list: displaying was incorrect
    when several marriages and one of them with an unknown ("? ?") person.
  - [Jul 18, 99] When updating families, the "sources" field is propagated
    into the created persons.
  - [Jul 18, 99] Fixed small bug for the access by subparts of surnames
    (it sometimes accepted too small subparts: then the "search" could
    give weird results).
  - [Jul 17, 99] In welcome page, now search by surname when search by
    full name fails (no need to select "surname"). Idem in relationship
    computing.
  - [Jul 17, 99] Fixed bug: could not access person after having changed his
    name, in some circumstances, e.g. changing the surname "L'epine" (in
    two words) into "Lepine" (one word).
  - [Jul 16, 99] Added a "back" button in case of update error (useful
    for browsers which loose the contents of the forms when navigating).
  - [Jul 15..29, 99] In relationship computing, added a long display,
    the ability to see the spouses in branches displaying, and the ability
    to cancel GeneWeb links.
  - [Jul 15, 99] Added system of grammar declinations (required by German,
    Esperanto, Czech). Changed the lexicon to use this new system.
  - [Jul 9, 99] Added link (upper arrow) to welcome page in displayings by
    first names and surnames.
  - [Jul 9, 99] Fixed date check for possible father when interval (i.e. was
    telling "incorrect" when father died between 1250 and 1260 and son born
    in 1255).
  - [Jul 3, 99] Added "af" as possible surnames particles (this is Danish)
    possibly ignored in "search".

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Jul 5, 99] Fixed bug sometimes stopping the program (exception
    "Invalid_argument") after the detection of an error of a family whose
    parents are of bad sex (female father and male mother).
  - [Jul 2, 99] Recognizes the dates of the form "FROM..TO..".

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [Jul 15, 99] Added option "-charset" whose values can be "ANSEL" or
    "ASCII": "ASCII" is the default. Deleted option "-ascii" now unuseful.
  - [Jul 2, 99] Generate now dates of the form "FROM..TO.." for titles.

* Base configuration files (base.gwf)
  - [Jul 18, 99] Added the key 'enclosing_tag' to enclose whole displayed
    text with one or several HTML tags. E.g. by setting it to 'strong', all
    text is displayed bold. Added comment about that in the template file
    "a.gwf".

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt) and Welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  - [Aug 5, 99] Updated Portuguese phrases (Yves Guignard)
  - [Aug 5..6, 99] Updated Norwegian phrases (Brynjulf Langballe)
  - [Aug 3, 99] Updated Danish phrases (Hans Albeck)
  - [Aug 3..6, 99] Updated Dutch phrases (Joris Esch)
  - [Aug 3, 99] Updated German phrases (Markus Mottl)
  - [Aug 2, 99] Updated Italian phrases (Daniel Hirschkoff)
  - [Jul 23, 99] Updated Swedish phrases (Lars Gustavsson)
  - [Jul 23, 99] Added Czech (Hanus Adler).
  - [Jul 17, 99] In welcome pages, simplified the text "it is a first
    name and surname or public name blah blah blah...".
  - [Jul 17, 99] Changed French term for "surname" ("nom" changed into
    "patronyme" more common among French genealogists).
  - [Jul 8, 99] Updated Swedish phrases (Stig Petersson)
  - [Jul 3, 99] Updated Danish phrases (Hans Albeck)

* Documentation
  - [Jul 27, 99] Updated Swedish documentation (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Jul 23, 99] Added documentation about the languages with declinations:
    "How to make modifications in the database", section 8.

GeneWeb version 2.04
--------------------

* Setup program
  - [Jun 28, 99] Fixed bug: did not work for directories holding spaces.
  - [Jun 19, 99] Changed GEDCOM import menu to reflect new option "-charset"
    of "ged2gwb" (see below in section "Gedcom to GeneWeb").
  - [Jun 18, 99] Added a color combination in the provided palette
    whiteyellow, black, bluegreen and brown (thanks to Hans Albeck)

* GeneWeb Daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Jun 30, 99] Added the ability to enter a Sosa number in the welcome page
    when navigating with someone as Sosa reference number (still available from
    its "ancestors" page).
  - [Jun 30, 99] In relationship links, display common ancestors in a more
    canonical order.
  - [Jun 28, 99] Due to optimization in consanguinity computing (see below),
    the answer time of relationship computing for persons without relationship
    links is generally faster (it answers: "no relationship links" faster).
  - [Jun 26, 99] Added the ability to access persons having composed surnames
    by subparts of their surname: e.g. "Josephine Tascher de La Pagerie" can
    now be found by typing just "Josephine Tascher" or "Josephine de La
    Pagerie".
  - [Jun 25, 99] Added short (horizontal) display for surnames by
    alphabetic order + ability to cancel GeneWeb links (for creation of
    static HTML pages).
  - [Jun 22, 99] Fixed bug: send image in CGI mode did not work.
  - [Jun 19..28, 99] Added in ancestors long display the ability to select
    and unselect the displaying of siblings and the displaying of notes.
  - [Jun 19, 99] Changed presentation of ancestors displaying main menu.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Jun 21, 99] Fixed bug: couples could sometimes be recorded as divorced,
    even if not (when there was a "1 DIV" field without DATE and PLAC in the
    gedcom file).
  - [Jun 19, 99] Can now read MSDOS accentuated characters encoding. Added
    option "-charset" which can be followed by "ANSEL", "ASCII" or "MSDOS".
    Removed options "-ansel" and "-no_ansel".
    Warning: in GEDCOM files, the charset "IBMPC" (which is not standard
    GEDCOM 5.5) is by default interpreted as "ASCII", *not* "MSDOS"; to
    override this default, the option "-charset MSDOS" will have to be used.

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [Jun 28, 99] Optimized code: it is twice faster (on average) now.

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt)
  - [Jun 30, 99] Translations added in Italian (Daniel Hirshkoff).
  - [Jun 18..Jul 1, 99] Translations improvements in Danish (Hans Albeck).

* Documentation
  - [Jun 30, 99] Updated Dutch documentation (Joris Esch).

GeneWeb version 2.03
--------------------

* Setup program
  - [Jun 7, 99] Added a Spanish version (Luis Castro Guzman).
  - [Jun 1, 99] The location to open is now always "http://localhost:2316/",
    independant from the selected language (no more need to end the location
    with "fr" or "en"): the page is displayed in the selected language.
  - [May 15, 99] Added deletion of ".gwo" file after then "gwc" operation.
  - [May 9, 99] Added predefined palette combination in "data base parameters";
    changed presentation of all page.
  - [May 9, 99] Added system to forbid non local accesses.
  - [May 7, 99] Fixed bug: recovering data base from old version of GeneWeb
    did not work when the old directory held spaces.
  - [May 7, 99] Fixed bad behavior under Windows: "GWU.EXE" (in uppercase)
    was not regognized when searching for old GeneWeb versions.
  - [May 7, 99] Fixed bug: "cleanup" under Windows did not work.

* GeneWeb  aemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Jun 7, 99] No more (stupid) abbreviation for "Number" in update forms:
    Did not work for many languages.
  - [Jun 3, 99] Added ability to use a new predefined term "+before" in the
    lexicon to specify the complement is before a verb (e.g. in German:
    "send" "image" is translated into "senden +before" "Bild", which gives
    at end: "Bild senden"; same solution for Dutch).
  - [May 31, 99] In ancestors only selected generation, added displaying
    of Sosa intervals (and "..." is displayed for non-contiguous intervals).
  - [May 18, 99] Added, in ancestors and descendants displaying, the ability
    to cancel GeneWeb links. Useful to extract a Web page for a site without
    GeneWeb server.
  - [May 16, 99] Fixed bug: in ascendants long displaying, did not display
    the last possible generation.
  - [May 15, 99] Added a "?" at end of empty requests (with just the data base
    name) because of too smart browsers which automatically add a "/" at end
    of the address in this case (transforming e.g. "http://host/base" into
    "http://host/base/"), what makes the request not working.
  - [May 14, 99] Fixed bug: in personal pages, the term "died" was sometimes
    missing when there was only a death place but no death date. Happened
    for persons born more than 120 years ago.
  - [May 12, 99] Fixed problem in CGI mode under Windows: sometimes displayed
    warning texts on the page.
  - [May 11, 99] Fixed bug: advanced search worked bad when neither "wizard"
    nor "friend": did not work when only specifying e.g. a first name
    or a surname of an existing (non "public") person.
  - [May 11, 99] Fixed bug: when adding ";opt=no_index" in URLs like explained
    in the doc ("How to put links to your base"), the used language was
    missing in the new URL.
  - [May 10, 99] Added ability to put relationship date for non married
    persons.
  - [May 7, 99] Fixed bug visible in Danish: the AE ligature ("&aelig;")
    was incorrectly capitalized.

* Lexicon (lang/lexicon.txt) and welcome pages (*/start.txt)
  - [Jun 7, 99] Changed terms in Dutch for sentences with verb at end.
  - [Jun 7, 99] Added missing terms in Portuguese (Yves Guignard).
  - [Jun 3, 99] Added missing terms in German (Markus Mottl).
  - [Jun 3, 99] Added some missing terms in Italian (Daniel Hirschkoff).
  - [Jun 2, 99] Fixed and completed translations in Swedish (Lars Gustavsson;
    some help also from Stig Petersson).
  - [May 31, 99] Corrected and completed Spanish sentences in lexicon
    and Spanish welcome page (Luis Castro Guzman).

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [May 19, 99] Better catenation of continuation (CONC) notes. In particular
    fixes the bug which sometimes added spaces inside words.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [May 19, 99] Fold notes lines at 255 characters (required by GEDCOM
    standard) adding CONC.

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [May 23, 99] Does not restart from scratch when changes: compute
    only what's necessary.

* Documentation
  - [May 13..31, 99] Updated Swedish documentation (Lars Gustavsson).

GeneWeb Version 2.02
--------------------

* New feature

  - [May 4, 99] Added a new program "setup" which will allow to
    use a lot of commands without having to type magic incantations in a
    MSdos (Windows) or Xterm (Unix) window. Everything is done in the Web
    navigator: creation of a database, extraction of a GEDCOM file, cleanup,
    etc etc.
    Should be convenient for non computer scientists beginners (and even for
    old timers computer scientists who already know GeneWeb).

* General
  - [Apr 22, 99] Added Danish language (by Hans Albeck).

* GeneWeb Daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [May 6, 99] Fixed bad behavior: in "modify person" form, a person was
    not considered as "buried", if the only area filled was "burial place".
  - [May 4, 99] Added button "include missing spouses" for missing ancestors.
  - [May 4, 99] Suppressed trace log count in CGI mode in not redirected
    in a file (option "-log"). Seemed to be incorrectly displayed in the

  - [Apr 29, 99] Fixed bug: when a persons first name, last name and number
    is the same as another person, GeneWeb shows a warning and suggests a new
    number. If the new number is selected, all special signs were
    transformed into codes.
  - [Apr 29, 99] Fixed small uncomfortable feature: when trying to save an
    image from a GeneWeb page, the browsers did not propose a correct file
    name to save this image (due to request syntax).
  - [Apr 29, 99] Added ability to change the first name and the surname
    of all children of a person in one only form. See new doc.
  - [Apr 26, 99] Fixed upload of "jpeg" files which sometimes did not work
    with Windows (message: "incorrect request")
  - [Apr 25, 99] Added space before "+" in short dates.

* Lexicon (lexicon.txt)
  - [Apr 23, 99] Some changes in Hebrew version (by Jonathan Marder).

GeneWeb Version 2.01
--------------------

* General
  - [Apr 2, 99] Added Norwegian language (Brynjulf Langballe).
  - [Mar 30, 99] Changed term "photo" into "image".

* GeneWeb Daemon/CGI (gwd)
  - [Apr 20, 99] Changed suffix ".cnf" into ".gwf" for configuration files
    (because of confusion with that predefined suffix in Windows).
  - [Apr 20, 99] In short dates (just year), if no birth date, baptism date
    is displayed.
  - [Apr 19, 99] In latest births and latest deaths displaying, the
    dates with just the year or just the month and the year are also taken
    into account.
  - [Apr 17, 99] Improved relationship branches displaying to be readable
    with Lynx (terminal browser without tables).
  - [Apr 16, 99] When merging persons, the lowest number is proposed by
    default.
  - [Apr 16, 99] Added long display for ancestors.
  - [Apr 13, 99] Fixed bug in personal pages: for people having a public
    name, the (small) links to the first name and surname could work
    bad in case of accents. Fixed other bug same kind: in advanced
    request, research did not work if accents were used...
  - [Apr 6, 99] Fixed bug in personal pages, titles dates were sometimes
    displayed just as "...".
  - [Apr 2, 99] Fixed bug: in missing ancestors in alphabetic order, the
    accents in surnames were incorrectly displayed.
  - [Mar 30, 99] Added the spouses when displaying relationship links with
    cousins (from the "cousin" link in personal pages).
  - [Mar 25, 99] Added the "unmarried" case for couples.
  - [Mar 23, 99] Added display of number of accesses in traces.
  - [Mar 17, 99] In person modification form, determines whether a person
    is died or not (if not specified), according to his age.
  - [Mar 16-19, 99] The presence of images in pages does not block any
    more the display of the text. For example, in welcome pages, the text
    does not wait for the displaying of the flags to be displayed, which
    is much more comfortable. (This applies only for local images).
  - [Mar 14, 99] In anniversaries, in the list of months, the selected
    month is now the current month, not always January.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Apr 2, 99] Added the automatic computation that a person is died or
    not (if not indicated in the gedcom), according to the person's age,
    and deleted the option "-nd".
  - [Mar 31, 99] Added option "-log" to redirect output.
  - [Mar 20, 99] Added options for dates where months are represented by
    numbers: -dates_dm when day before month and -dates_md when month
    before day.
  - [Mar 16, 99] Did not work for gedcom files with white spaces in the
    beginning of the lines. Fixed.
  - [Mar 11, 99] Fixed horrible bug: treatment of accents worked bad for
    gedcom files with ascii charset (resulting problems in "a" umlaut, for
    example).

* Consanguinity computing (consang)
  - [Mar 26, 99] Added option -q for quiet mode, just displaying a progress
    bar.

* Lexicon (lexicon.txt) and Welcome files (xx/start.txt)
  - [Mar 10, 99] Some changes in Italian version (by Raffaele Sena).

    for the "death state" (see above), file "update.htm", section 5.4 "modify
    a person", paragraph "Death".

* Internal
  - [Mar 24, 99] (working Unix only) Added options "-setuid" and "-setgid"
    to "gwd" to change the user or group id after socket bind. This allows
    for example to use the port 80 (root needed) but accessing data as
    normal user.

GeneWeb Version 2.00
--------------------

From the version 2.00, the license is GPL (GNU General Public
License). The previous license still applies up to the version 1.11

    were often truncated.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - [Feb 14, 99] Assumed wrongly that all families were defined after
    individuals, because it is often the case in Gedcom files. But this is
    not mandatory in definition Gedcom 5.5. Fixed.
  - [Feb 6, 99] Accept dates with "/" (20/11/1993) although it is not
    standard Gedcom 5.5. Interpreted as day/month/year.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - [Feb 26, 99] Fixed error: the first name alias if any was always saved
    in the gedcom as first name. Now saved only as first name if it starts
    with the first name (e.g. if first name = "John" and first name alias =
    "John Philip Robert").

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Feb 19, 99] The option "-cg" did not work. Fixed.

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)

    name of the base in the same context. For example, in a source field,
    if "John Smith" is in the same database, it is possible to record it
    as:
      <a href="%sp=john;n=smith">John Smith</a>
  - [Jan 11, 99] Display declined forms (for some languages). E.g.:
      * in German: "x ist ein Sohn von einem Cousin von y"
	  ("einem" instead of the inkorrect "ein").
      * in Esperanto: "aldoni personon"
          ("personon" instead of the incorrect "persono")

* GeneWeb compiler (gwc)
  - [Jan 26, 99] Fixed bug: failure when backslashes in source.
  - [Jan 18, 99] Fixed two bugs in dates parsing: 1. "x..y" (between x and

  - [Jan 19, 99] Fixed bug: the tag "<br>" was converted into a new line
    only in lowercase form; "<BR>" did not work.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb and GeneWeb to Gedcom (ged2gwb, gwb2ged)
  - [Jan 18, 99] When there are several names (several records "1 NAME") for
    someone in Gedcom, the other become "aliases" (and vice versa for
    gwb2ged).

* GeneWeb uncompiler (gwu)
  - [Feb 4, 99] Notes for persons having "?" no more saved (these
    persons are supposed to be deadends and this made "gwc" fail).

* Lexicon file (lexicon.txt)
  - [Feb 3, 99] Some changes in Swedish translation (Lars Gustavsson).
  - [Jan 28, 99] Added section "!dir" for languages written right to left.
  - [Jan 28, 99] [minor] Portuguese translation now in pure ascii using
    HTML "&" macros instead of accents (no changes in Portuguese displaying)

    for use".
  - [Jan 24, 99] Added doc for default photo name (new feature) in "directions
    for use", page "modifications", section 5.4 ("modify a person"),
    paragraph "Photo".

    relationship computing (because confusion with the usual meaning of
    the term "consanguinity").

    continued...)
  - [19/12/98] Fixed bug quotes disappearing in field "first name aliases"
    in form Update/Person (if the value holds quotes).
  - [18/12/98] No more HTML "table" used in relationship links with
    one branch (=> more compact display and visible in browsers
    without tables, e.g. "lynx").
  - [13/12/98] The directory cnt is no more searched in the directory where
    the daemon (or the CGI) is launched but in the base directory (option -bd
    of gwd; no difference if option -bd not used).

  - [12/12/98] Added option "-mem" to save memory space, but slower.

* Documentation
  - [09/01/99] Changed link to "LICENCE" which did not always work.
--- [04/01/99] Added dutch version (thanks to Joris Esch).

GeneWeb Version 1.09
--------------------

* Inside databases
--- Precisions of dates now apply not only for years, but for complete
    date. E.g. "maybe on september 1815" or "after september 23, 1815".
--- In dates, added case "between": between year and another year.
  - Structure of databases have been changed for these two above points.
  - Area "comment" in families is now kept even if there are children.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb (ged2gwb)
  - Delete of duplicated FAMS which sometimes happen in erroneous Gedcoms.
  - Delete families from GEDCOM when parents dont have the good sex.
  - Added displaying of line number when syntax errors and unrecognized dates.
  - Get sources if defined by pointer (but just the 1st line).
  - Added option "-no_nd" (no negative dates), not to interpret years preceded
    by a minus sign as negative dates.

* GeneWeb to Gedcom (gwb2ged)
  - Added option "-ascii" to output in ASCII encoding instead of ANSEL.

* Gedcom to GeneWeb and GeneWeb to Gedcom (ged2gwb, gwb2ged)
  - The <em>GeneWeb</em> fields "public name", "surname alias" and
    "photo" are now loaded from and saved to Gedcom resp. as: "2 GIVN",
    "2 SURN" and "1 OBJE (newline) 2 FILE".

* GeneWeb daemon/CGI (gwd)
--- Added alibity to specify someone as Sosa reference. Then the Sosa
    number is printed in navigation when displaying ancestors. Thanks to
    Emmanuelle Visseaux for this idea.
--- Restructuration of displaying of surnames and first names by alphabetic
    order and frequency. Fixed bug of bad alphabetic order when first names
    and surnames with accents. Access in indexes faster.
  - In list by title places, added clickable "The whole list" giving the
    list of all persons associated with this place, whatever the title.
  - Descendants display limited to 12 generations in all cases (else too much
    text or too long to answer).
  - Added error message in relationship computing when loop in
    database (someone being his/her own ancestor).
  - In "search", added ability to write "I" instead of "Ier" (french form).
    Ex: "Charles I" or "Charles Ier" are both accepted.
  - Added ability to add ";opt=no_index" at end of requests to get an
    equivalent link independant from the persons' index number (useful
    to put direct links in Web pages).
  - Added text "Parents of" in top of pages of missing ancestors.
  - Fixed still several bugs (accents) due to new ANSEL encoding.

* Base configuration files (xxx.cnf)
  - Added variable "wizard_just_friend" to suspend the powers of
    "wizards" (e.g. for maintenance): when set to "yes", they become
    simple "friends" (default: "no").
  - Variable "renamed" can be used to specify that a database has been
    renamed. Generates a page giving the good URL to use.

* GeneWeb compiler and Consanguinity computing (gwc, consang)
  - Fixed accents displaying in traces and error messages.

* Welcome pages (start.txt)
  - Fixed wrong displaying of number of accesses in spanish (es) and
    portuguese (pt) versions.
  - Display thousand separators in numbers of accesses.

* Documentation (directory doc)
  - Added 2 cases in FAQ.
  - Many small changes.

GeneWeb Version 1.08
--------------------

* Added portuguese among languages (thanks to Yves Guignard).

* gwd:
  - fixed several displaying bugs due to ANSEL
  - in forms, when a precision (about, maybe, before, after, or year) is given
    for a date, the day and month part are ignored, since its works only for
    years (for the moment).
  - photos and background in directory "images" can be installed in a
    subdirectory having the name of the database; ex: "images/martin" for
    the database "martin".

* gwc, gwu:
  - added backslash as escape character for underscores

* gwc:
  - save much much memory space while running when there are many many notes

* ged2gwb:

  - added option -nd setting flag "not dead" instead of "don't know if dead"
    for personal records where "DEAT" exists but is empty.

* gwb2ged:
  - start now pointers with 1 instead of 0 because some softwares seem not
    to accept @I0@ and @F0@.
  - generate always ANSEL encoding

  - added option -d to select descendants like in gwb2ged

GeneWeb Version 1.06

* bug fixes:
  - Fixed a problem of blocking: the symptom was that, in some
    versions of Windows 95, "gwd" started normally, but when opening
    the site in the navigator, the site was found but the navigator was
    waiting and waiting forever.
  - When updating a person, if the "notes" field holds only a newline,
    the request is rejected => fixed. Moreover some browsers add this "bad"
    newline if the notes fields is empty => fixed.

* gwd, ged2gwb, gwb2ged:
  - added baptism (separated from birth) and burial/cremation.

  - added request m=R;p=..;n=..;p1=..;n1=.. displaying relationship
    between two persons by their names

* ged2gwb:
  - when converting a date with qualifier, if the date holds day or month,
    converts into: "ca Year". Ex: "AFT APR 1218" is read as "ABT 1218".
  - fixed bug: date 16/2/1964 gave "year = 16" instead of "year = 1964"

* gwd, a.cnf, lang/lexicon.txt
  - deleted principle of "message" (was undocumented, anyway)

* gwd, doc:
  - changed terminology "occurrence number" into just "number" (I realized
    that "occurrence" is mathematical jargon).

* gwd, lang/*/start.txt:
  - displaying of total number of accesses, not only accesses in welcome page

* in all commands:
  - options -help display message on standard output instead of standard

  - fixed bug: error while treating anniversaries of marriage in
    databases where families had been deleted:
       Uncaught exception: Failure("access persons out of bounds")

GeneWeb Version 1.01

GeneWeb Version 1.0
-------------------

CGI mode is Ok.

* gwd, ged2gwb, lang/lexicon.txt:
  - errors on dates become warnings

GeneWeb Version 1.0-beta.10
---------------------------

Still intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode.

* gwd:
  - fixed bug: update did not work in cgi mode.
  - print person link after "family switch"
  - when using "add parents", surname is printed in child area => ability
    to change father's.

GeneWeb Version 1.0 beta.9
--------------------------

Intermediate version to perfect "CGI" mode under Windows NT.

* More documentation

* gwd:
  - cgi is detected by the presence of environment variable QUERY_STRING.
    It seems that .bat files is not accepted in Web servers in Windows NT,
    so one must use "gwd" itself.
  - if "gwd" is installed in cgi directory, and is renamed, e.g. "geneweb.exe",
    ability to add a file named "geneweb.arg" holding some lines
       * the first line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where "lang" is installed
       * the second line if existing holds the name of the directory
            where the databases are installed
       * the third line, if existing, may hold the string "cgi" telling
            that gwd must run on "cgi" mode, even if QUERY_STRING is
            not set
  - added option -bd: bases directory
  - no error message now if background not found

* Deleted "add/person" in update (gwd) and in welcome pages (lang/*/start.txt)
  => impossibility now to directly create isolated persons. This is because
  it often leads to manipulation errors. To add a new baby, use "modify
  family" from one of his parents' personal record.
