# Test Documentation (lib)

## Testing policy

Our testing policy ensures that all critical functions are covered by automated tests.
We use unit tests to verify individual components and integration tests for system-wide behavior.
Tests are run automatically on each commit, and failures must be resolved before merging.
Documentation for each test is generated to maintain transparency and traceability.

### Writing Tests

To ensure consistency and clarity, tests for the `lib` module should follow this structure:

```python
def test_<test_name_in_snake_case>():
    """One-line summary of what the test verifies."""
    # Test implementation goes here
```

- Place each test in the corresponding file:
  `src/tests/lib/test_<module_name_in_snake_case>.py`
- Use descriptive function names and docstrings to clearly state the purpose of each test.
- Keep tests focused, isolated, and easy to maintain.
- Follow existing conventions for setup, teardown, and assertions.
- Review and update tests regularly to reflect changes in the codebase.
## Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that:

- All tests pass without regressions.
- New or modified code is covered by appropriate tests.
- Test documentation is updated to reflect any changes.
- The code adheres to project conventions and style guidelines.
- The pull request description clearly explains the changes and their impact.

Automated checks will run on each pull request to verify test coverage and code quality.
