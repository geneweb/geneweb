# Templates.

# Some pages, not all, have templates, including:

# - the personal page, perso.txt
# - the update person form, updind.txt
# - the update family form, updfam.txt
# The standard templates are located in the /etc/ directory of the GeneWeb
# distribution.
#
# Other templates can be added in the databases directory in a subdirectory
# also named etc: e.g. etc/foo/perso.txt, etc/bar/perso.txt, and so on.
#
# The "template" variable tells which templates are allowed for this
# database and gives the default template. It is a list of directories
# separated by commas. Empty directory means "the standard template".
# Star means "any template". The first of the list gives the default
# template to be used. Examples:
#
# template=*       any template allowed; default = standard one
# template=foo,*   any template allowed; default = foo
# template=foo,bar only foo and bar templates allowed
# template=foo,    only foo and standard template allowed; default = foo
# template=,foo    only foo and standard template allowed; default = standard
# template=        only standard template allowed
# template=foo     only foo template allowed
#
# Default is template=database-name,*
# The template to be used can be changed by adding ";templ=foo" in the URL
#
#template=a,*

# If yes, expand the (system) environment variables found in the values of
# the customized variables. You can write ${xxx} to expand the variable
# xxx. E.g., if HOME is /home/smith and if you define:
#    var_foo=my home is ${HOME}, guys!
# the customized variable %vfoo; is expanded into:
#    my home is /home/smith, guys!
