# Templates.
#
# Some pages, not all, have templates, including:
# - the welcome page, welcome.txt
# - the personal page, perso.txt
# - the update person form, updind.txt
# - the update family form, updfam.txt
# The standard templates are located in the etc directory of the GeneWeb
# distribution.
#
# Other templates can be added in the databases directory in a subdirectory
# also named etc: e.g. etc/foo/perso.txt, etc/bar/perso.txt, # and so on.
#
# The "template" variable tells which templates are allowed for this
# database and gives the default template. It is a list of directories
# separated by commas. Empty directory means "the standard template".
# Star means "any template". The first of the list gives the default
# template # to be used. Examples:
#
# template=*       any template allowed; default = standard one
# template=foo,*   any template allowed; default = foo
# template=foo,bar only foo and bar templates allowed
# template=foo,    only foo and standard template allowed; default = foo
# template=,foo    only foo and standard template allowed; default = standard
# template=        only standard template allowed
# template=foo     only foo template allowed
#
# Default is template=database-name,*
# The template to be used can be changed by adding ";templ=foo" in the URL
#
#template=a,*

# Customized variables.
#
# You can define any variable here, starting with "var_".
#
# They will be replaced in the displayed "notes", "sources", "comments"
# and in the database forum. If the variable name is "var_something",
# it replaces all occurrences of "%vsomething;" in these texts.
#
# Example. if you define here:
#   var_who=Bond, James Bond
# and if the notes is "My name is %vwho;.", the displayed text in the notes
# will be:
#   My name is Bond, James Bond.

expand_env=no
# If yes, expand the (system) environment variables found in the values of
# the customized variables. You can write ${xxx} to expand the variable
# xxx. E.g., if HOME is /home/smith and if you define:
#    var_foo=my home is ${HOME}, guys!
# the customized variable %vfoo; is expanded into:
#    my home is /home/smith, guys!
# The default is "no" because it may be a security hole to allow accommodated
# databases in a Web site to show the environment variables of the command
# gwd. Check that before putting "expand_env" to "yes".
