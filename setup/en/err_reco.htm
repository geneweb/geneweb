<h1>Error</h1>

The previous command exited with an error code. Your data base "$o" may
have not been created. Look at the <a
href="gwsetup?lang=$l;v=traces.htm">traces</a>, maybe you can find
an explanation.

<p>

You may have come from a too old version of <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>. In this
case, <a href="gwsetup?lang=$l;v=recover.htm">try again</a> to do the
transfer using the option to "pass by a GEDCOM file" (you can also
go back to the previous screen to do it).

<p>

If you were already doing that, and it does not work better, ask the
creator of the <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> program. Send him the traces of the
command.

<p>

You can return to the <a href="gwsetup?lang=$l;v=main.htm">main menu</a>.
