You can create a CD-ROM of your database with <font
color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> included inside: it allows you
to distribute your database directly usable.

<p>

This chapter explains the minimum steps to manage to do it. This
installation has the advantage that the user has nothing to install
in his hard disk, neither the software, nor the database.

<p>

Here are the operations to do:

<p>

<ol>

<li> Do a deep cleanup of your database. If you have gwsetup, use it:
look at its "main menu". You can also do that with the commands gwu
and gwc (gwu extracts the database as source text and gwc recreates
it).

<p>

<font size=-1>Remark: this step is not absolutely mandatory but allows
to distribute a database which is optimized in memory space and in
access speed. However, if your database comes from a GEDCOM file or
from a <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> source file and if
you made no changes in your database, it is un-useful.</font>

<p>

<li> If you want that the consanguinities be displayed in the personal
pages and in the relationship computings, run the program of
initialization of consanguinities. Under gwsetup, see the "main
menu". Interactively, this can be done with the command consang.

<p>

<font size=-1>Remark: step also optional. If you don't do it, the
relationship work even so but the consanguinities are not
displayed.</font>

<p>

<li> Enter in your database and do any relationship computing, for
example between a father and his son.

<p>

<font size=-1>Remark: this is also an optional step to optimize the
access to the database. Indeed, the first relationship computing
builds a file (named tstab) in the database which allows the future
relationship computings to go faster. If this file was not created, it
will not be possible in the CD-ROM and the relationship computings will
be slower.</font>

<p>

<li> Create a directory for the items that you are going to put in
your CD-ROM. This directory is named "destination" for the following
explanation.

<p>

<li> Transfer your database in the destination directory: your data
base is a directory ending with ".gwb". For example, if your database
is named "xyz", the directory is "xyz.gwb". This directory is located
in the databases directory (depending on your installation: Windows,
MacOS X, Unix, Linux rpm, Linux Debian...)

<p>

<li> Add a configuration file in the destination directory. If you
have some which fits you, use it, otherwise create it. The
configuration file is a text file ending by ".gwf": if your database
is "xyz", the file is "xyz.gwf". If this file already exists, it is
also in the database directory.

<p>

In this file, add a phoney "wizard" password, by adding the line:

<pre>
     wizard_passwd=a
</pre>

<p>

<font size=-1>Remark: this operation is optional but it allows to avoid
that it proposes a "update" in the personal pages, updating which would
not work anyway on a write-only support. Warning: if you create a
configuration file, check that the extension ".txt" is <em>not</em>
added like some OS badly do automatically: the extension must be .gwf
and nothing else.</font>

<p>

<li> Copy the executable "gwd" in the destination directory. In some
systems, it has the extension ".exe". Warning: there may be several
files named "gwd" in your <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>
installation.  The good one is a rather big file (more thab 1 Mb). It
is generally under a directory named "gw".

<p>

<li> Copy in the destination directory the directories "lang", "etc"
and "images" (and their contents) which must be located in the same
directory as the one where you found gwd.

<p>

<font size=-1>Remark: the presence of these directories is mandatory.
They contain files used by gwd, in particular for all languages and for
the displaying of some pages.</font>

<p>

<li> In the directory "lang" of the destination directory, edit the
file named "start.txt" and delete the group of lines which contain
the links for the "wizard" access. They start with something like:

<pre>
   &lt;td align=center&gt;[
   af: &lt;a href="%sw=w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medewerkers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; toegang&lt;br&gt; (password)
   ca: acc&eacute;s &lt;a href="%sw=w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;administrador&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; (clau)
</pre>

and end with:

<pre>
   pl: &lt;a href="%sw=w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Wizard"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dostêp&lt;br&gt; (has³o)
   pt: Entrada &lt;a href="%sw=w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;feiticeiro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; (palavra chave)
   sv: &lt;a href="%sw=w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uppdaterings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tilltr&auml;de&lt;br&gt; (passord)
   ]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</pre>

<p>

<font size=-1>This step is not mandatory but avoid that the welcome
page proposes a wizard access which would not work, anyway.</font>

<p>

<li><b>Important step</b>. The executable gwd builds files in its
current directory. If it cannot do it, it can block its operation (in
particular, under Windows, it will not work certainly). An option must
be indicated in order that it uses the hard disk (note: these files
are not big, are temporary and destroying them explicitely or by
mistake will not perturbate gwd).

<p>

For that, create a text file named "gwd.arg" (warning: not "gwd.arg.txt"
but just "gwd.arg") and write inside:

<pre>
   If you prepare a CD-ROM for Windows:
          -wd
          c:\temp\geneweb
   If it is for Unix or MacOS X:
          -wd
          /tmp/geneweb
</pre>

<p>

<li>If your database has images, put them in the directory images,
sub directory holding the name of your database ("images/xyz" if
your database is named "xyz").

<p>

<li> After all these steps, you have a minimum installation, obliging
the user to launch gwd himself and open the URL address to access the
database. You can improve that by providing HTML files and/or scripts
(shell, batch) which launch all that. You can also put several data
bases, other HTML files and so on.

<p>

<font size=-1>

Don't ask me how to make a CD-ROM which launches all of that automatically
when you insert it in its support: there is probably tricks to do that
but I don't know.

<p>

Remark: if you want that your database be readable under other
Operating Systems than the one you use, you can create a directory for
each OS and put the version of gwd inside. Of course, you must have
downloaded the versions of <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>
for all these systems. You have also to look at the files "gwd.arg"
(one by gwd file) and in particular ask them to indicate the
access path to the database (options -hd and -bd of gwd).

</font>

<p>

<li>Before engraving your disk, do a test. For that, change the access
rights of the destination directory and all its files and directory:
make them no-writable. Then launch the command gwd (by double-click or
by an interactive command). Open in your Web navigator the address
http://127.0.0.1:2317/xyz (if your database is named xyz) and check
if it works.

<p>

<li>If it is Ok, create your CD-ROM with the destination directory and
its contents.
