This part indicates you how to make modifications in a database using
your navigator. If the database owner has installed a password, you
have to enter it in the welcome page to have access to the different
possibilities of updating.

<p>

Before starting, it is important to understand the basic notions:
first, the notion of "first name", "surname", "number", and second,
the notions of "persons" and "families". This allows you to understand
the next sections about updating.

<ul>

<li> <a href="#FSO">1.</a> First names, surnames, numbers.

<li> <a href="#PF">2.</a> Persons and Families.

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400><a name="FSO">1.</a> First names, surnames, numbers </font></h3>

Each person of the base is located by his first name, his surname and
his number, this last information allowing to distinguish two persons
having the same first name and the same surname. This set is named the
person's "key" (<a href="#note">note</a>).

<p>

So, if there are two "John Smith" in the database, you can
differentiate them by the number. Any number is valid and you are not
obliged to start from 0 or 1, nor counting by adding 1 each time.  For
example, your first "John Smith" can have the number 7 and the second,
the number 4. One will be represented by "John", "Smith", "7" and the
second by "John", "Smith", "4".

<p>

<em>You</em> choose this number, except if you started from a GEDCOM file:
in this case, "ged2gwb" has chosen it number for you, for all persons
of the base.

<p>

This number appears only in updating pages: they are not visible in
the normal pages. So, if you type the name "John Smith" in the welcome
page, <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> gives a choice between "John Smith 7" and
"John Smith 4", but without displaying explicitly the numbers.

<p>

However, as you are a "guru" since you make updatings, know that you
can put a "dot" and the number between the first name and the surname.

For example, in the welcome page, you can search "John .4 Smith" and
you find directly the one whose number is 4.

<p>

Also note that:

<ul>

<li> Accents and uppercase letters are not taken into account in this
differentiation. So "john", "smith", "5" gives access to the same
person than "JOHN", "SMITH", "5" and "John", "Smith", "5".

<li> When there is no number, its value is actually 0. Not setting it
or setting 0 are the same thing.

</ul>

It is important to understand correctly this notion, because some of
the error messages you have concerns this. For example, the messages
like:

<ul>

<li> "Person already existing": this means that you are trying to
create a person whose combination "first name", "name", "number" is
already reserved, which happens:

<p>

<ul>

<li> Either in a context where you wanted to create a new person.

<li> Or in a context where you wanted to change the first name, the
surname or the number of a given person.

</ul>

<p>

<li> "Unknown person": this means that nobody in the base corresponds
to this combination "first name", "name", "number", which happens when
you want to link a given person in a family as father, mother or
child.

</ul>

Note also that this number has nothing to do with the number of first
names of noble persons: "Edward III" has not necessarily the number
"3". However, and this is not a contradiction, it is good usage,
although not mandatory, to choose the same number, whenever possible:
you will see that is more practical.

<p>

But most of the time, there is no need to specify a number. Write nothing:
it will be 0 by default and it is Ok.

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400><a name="PF">2.</a> Persons and Families </font></h3>

The <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> databases, internally, hold two main notions:
persons and families:

<ul>

<li> Persons hold individual data such as first name, surname, number,
dates and places of birth, baptism, death, the possible nobility
titles, etc, etc.

<li> Families hold simple families: father, mother, children, date and
place of possible marriage and divorce. Note that if a person is
married several times, there will be as many "families" as there are
marriages.

</ul>

The updatings of the base are simply and exclusively updating of
"persons" and "families": adding, modification, deletion.

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400><a name="MAJ">3.</a> Access to updatings </font></h3>

If you are sure you understand well the two previous sections, you
can now start.

<p>

To access to updatings, you can:

<ul>

<li> Either click on "Add a family" in the welcome page.

<li> Or click on "Update" in a personal record.

</ul>

In the welcome page, clicking on "Add a family" allows you to start
filling an empty database.

<p>

You see then a form to add a family. Report to the section <a
href="#AddF">Add a Family</a>.

<p>

In a personal record, clicking on "Update" allows you to see a page
where some choices are proposed. This choices depend on the familial
situation of the person:

<ol><li value=1> In all cases, you have the choice "Modify" and
"Delete": it is the modification or deletion of the person. Report
to the sections:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#ModP">Modify a Person</a>

<li> <a href="#DelP">Delete a Person</a>

</ul>

<p>

If the database owner gave the authorisation (see <a
href="start.htm#Cnf">Configuration file</a>), you get the choice "Send
image". Report to the sections:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#SndP">Send an Image</a>

<li> <a href="#DelPh">Delete an Image</a>

</ul>

</ol>

<ol><li value=2> If the person is married, you have, for each marriage,
the choice "Modify/Family" and "Delete/Family". Report to the sections:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#ModF">Modify a Family</a>

<li> <a href="#DelF">Delete a Family</a>

</ul>

</ol>

<ol><li value=3> If there are several marriages, there is a choice
"Invert" between each marriage, allowing you to invert the order
of the families.

</ol>

<ol><li value=4> In other cases, this familial list ends with
"Add/Family".  You see the same form than "Add a family" of the
welcome page, except that the person will be prefilled in the form in
one of the parents (according to the sex). Report to the section:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#AddF">Add a Family</a>

</ul>

</ol>

<ol><li value=5> A choice is proposed also to change the children's
names. This allows to change the first name and the surname of all
the children of a person in one only form. Report to the section:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#ChgC">Change the children's names</a>

</ul>

</ol>

<ol><li value=6> At the end, if the person has no parents, the choice
"Add/Parents" is proposed. This also gives the form "Add/Family" with
the person prefilled as a child and his surname in the "name" area of
the father. Report to the section:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="#AddF">Add a Family</a>

</ul>

</ol>

<p> Remarks:

<ul><li>

All these choices lead either to forms to fill, or to confirmation
asking: you do not do anything definitive by clicking in this page:
it is always possible to go back.

<p>

So "Delete" (choice number 1) will delete the person only if you
click on "Ok" in the next page which will be proposed to you.

</ul>

<ul><li>

In the forms, it may happen that some fields are prefilled.
This does not mean that you cannot change its contents.

<p>

So in "Add/Parents" (choice number 6), the surname of the father is
prefilled. But this is just a commodity due to the fact that father
and child have frequently the same surname: but if the father has
another one, you can absolutely change it.

</ul>

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400><a name="Part">4.</a> Some specific points </font></h3>

These points are highlighted because they are possible pitfalls:
do follow the indicated procedure.

<p>

<h4> <a name="ModC">4.1.</a> How to modify the first name or the surname of
a child </h4>

Example: in the family of "John Smith" and "Barbara Jones", one of the
children has been named "Robert", although his first name was actually
"Philip":

<p>

What you must do:

<ul><li>

Go to the personal record of "Robert Smith", click on "Update", then
"Modify" and proceed like indicated in the section "Modify a
Person" (choice number 1 in the section 3).

</ul>

What you must <em>not</em> do:

<ul><li>

Do not use "Modify/Family" (choice number 2 in the section 3).

<p>

If you do that and change "Robert" into "Philip" in the form:

<p>

<ul>

<li> This will cut the connection between "Robert" and his parents,
and "Robert" continue to be named "Robert Smith", but without parents.

<li> This will set "Philip Smith", if he exists and does not already have
parents, as a child of the couple.

<li> But if this "Philip Smith" does not exist in the base or else
he exists but already has parents, an error message will be displayed
and nothing will be changed (fortunately).

</ul>

</ul>

<h4> <a name="AddC">4.2.</a> How to add a child in a family </h4>

For example, in the family of "John Smith" and "Barbara Jones", you
want to add "Hubert" as a child:

<p>

What you must do:

<ul><li>

Go to the personal record of one of the parents, click on "Update",
then "Modify/Family" (choice number 2 in the section 3), and add the
child as indicated in the section "Modify a Family".

</ul>

What you must <em>not</em> do:

<ul><li>

Do not use "Add/Family" (number 4 in the section 3) which does not
mean "add a child in a family" but "add a new marriage", creating
a new entity "family" with a new spouse.

</ul>

<ul><li>

Moreover, if the child already exists in the base and you want to add
it in the list of the children of an already existing couple, do not
use "Add/Parents" (choice number 4 of the section 3) either.

<p>

The choice "Add/Parents" is rather used to add parents to one of
your ancestors to go up a little more. This choice also creates
a new family.

</ul>

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400><a name="Form">5.</a> Forms </font></h3>

<h4> <a name="AddF">5.1.</a> Add a Family </h4>

You see this form titled "Add/Family":

<ul>

<li> Either from the welcome page, when clicking on "Add a family";
in this case, no area of the form is prefilled,

<li> Or from a personal record, after having clicked on "Update", then
"Add/Family"; in this case, the areas "first name", "surname" and
"number" are prefilled, for the father or the mother according to the
sex of the person,

<li> Or, in the same context, after having clicked on "Add/Parents",
if this choice was proposed; in this case, the "surname" area of the
father will be prefilled, so are the areas "first name", "surname" and
"number" of their first (and only) child.  Remark that you can
absolutely change the surname of the father, if it is different.

</ul>

This form behaves exactly like "Modify a Family", except that it
creates a new family. As many times you use it, as many times a
family is created.

<p>

This means that if you notice that you made mistakes after having
validated the form, do not do "Add/Family" again, but "Modify/Family"!

<p>

Report to the following paragraph to see how to fill the form.

<h4> <a name="ModF">5.2.</a> Modify a Family </h4>

You see this form from a personal record, after having clicked on
"Update", then "Modify/Family". This form is prefilled by the "first
name", the "surname" and the "number" of the father, the mother and
the children, as well as all the possible data relative to this
family.

<p>

This form behaves like "Add/Family" of the previous section (except
that there is no creation of a new family). What follows is therefore
valid for the form "Add/Family".

<p><strong>Filling</strong><p>

All areas (prefilled or not) can be filled, erased or modified. When
you have finished filling, erasing and modifying all you judge
necessary, go to the end of the form and commit the form by clicking
on "Ok".

<p>

In the area where there are persons, remark the selection "Link" and
"Create". According to the case, it will be preselected to "Link" or
"Create". You can change this selection according to what you want to
do.

<ul><li>

"Link" means that the person already exists in the base. When committing,
the system checks that this persons exists and, for a parent, that he
is of the good sex.

<p>

Note that as it is a research by "key" (see first section), it is not
necessary to respect accents, lowercase and uppercase.

</ul>

<ul><li> 

"Create" means that the person does not exists in the base and that
you ask the system, when committing, to create him with the indicated
first name, surname and number.

<p>

Here, what is different from "Link", you must write the accents, uppercases
and lowercases correctly: the person will be created with the spelling
you write there.

<p>

You can enter the child's sex and his day of birth. For his other
personal data, you will have to do "update" later from his personal
page.

</ul>

When committing, the cases "child" whose area "first name" is empty are
ignored, whatever the contents of the other areas. It is like they do
not exist.

<p>

For children, the field "name" is optional: if it is absent,
the name of the father is taken.

<p><strong>Some modifications</strong><p>

Here are some modifications you can do:

<ul><li>

<strong>To add a child</strong>, if there is no free area for him,
click first on the button "Insert/Child" according to the place where
you want to add him in the family. Then click on "Ok" at end of the
form.

<p>

Remark: this will not commit the form immediately. The system will just
propose you another form with a reserved place for the child or children
you want to add.

<p>

Therefore warning: as long as you click on "Insert/Child", when you
click in "Ok", there is no committing: just another bigger form. You
must not interpret this button as "add me this child I just wrote":
the system sees it, don't worry.

<p>

The child you type in the area you allocated for him may be an existing
person in the base. In this case, select "Link" instead of "Create".

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>To delete a child</strong>, simply erase his first name. As
said above, cases whose first name area is empty are ignored when
committing. Remark that it will not delete the person: he will simply
be removed form the list of the children and will be himself without
parents.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>To change a child's position</strong>, the simplest way is to
click on "Insert/Child" at the position you want to set him, and do
"Ok". In the new proposed form, type the child's data in the new case,
select "Link" instead of "Create" and erase his first name in the old
area.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>To invert the position of two children</strong>, you can
proceed with the same way, passing through a new case in order to
simply cut and paste. Do not forget to select "Link".

<p>

You can also do it directly, without adding a new room: the problem is
you have to remember one of the two names, when you erase it to type
the other one at his location.

</ul>

<p><strong>Committing</strong><p>

The committing takes place when you click on "Ok". As long as you do
not do it, no change is done in the base.

<p>

Remark also that, as it is said above, that if you selected one or
several "Insert/Child", just a new form is proposed: this is
<em>not</em> the proper committing.

<p>

When the committing is really done, you must see a new page whose
title is:

<ul><li>

Either: <strong>Family added or modified</strong><p>

You see then the parents' names on which you can click.

<p>

Maybe you also see warnings. They concern dates or children order
inconsistencies. The update is done anyway, but it is preferable to
fix them, if necessary.

<p>

Clicking on one of the parents, you see his personal record. But your
update may not be visible. Web navigators use to keep already
displayed pages in memory, and probably display the old version.
Do "reload the page" in your navigator to really see your modifications.

</ul>

<ul><li>

Or: <strong>Error</strong><p>

The page indicates the encountered error. Go back and fix it. You can
also give up... doing nothing and go on navigating in the base.

<p>

If the error indicates you that some person already exists, it means
you wanted to create a person whose combination "first name",
"surname", "number" is already present in the base.

<p>

Solution:

<p>

<ul>

<li> If you really wanted to create a new person, go back and change
his number. Remark that the error page give you the first free,
therefore available, number: choose it or another one. If there are
several persons with the same name, their list is displayed.

<li> If it was the good person you wanted to have, go back and change
"Create" into "Link"."

</ul>

<p>

Then do "Ok" again.

<p>

If the error indicated you that some person does not exist, this means
that you selected "Link" in front of an non existing person. Maybe you
chose a wrong number? Or did you want actually to create a new
person?

</ul>

<h4> <a name="DelF">5.3.</a> Delete a Family </h4>

You see this form, titled "Delete/Family" from a personal record, after
having clicked on "Update", the "Delete/Family".

<p>

The form only holds the button "Ok" to allow you to do it really.
You can still give up.

<p>

If you do "Ok", a new page appears with the title "Family deleted".

<p>

The family is removed from the base: the father, the mother and the
children scatter. However none of them is deleted: just the father
and the mother are no more married, they have no more these children
(they may have other ones from other marriages, which are persisting),
the children have no more parents.


<h4> <a name="ModP">5.4.</a> Modify a Person </h4>

You see this form titled "Modify/Person" from a personal record,
after having clicked on "Update", then "Modify". The form is prefilled
with all the individual data of this person.

<p><strong>Filling</strong><p>

All areas (prefilled or not) can be filled, erased or modified.  When
you filled, erased, modified all you judge necessary, go to the end of
the form and commit the form by clicking on "Ok".

<p>

Some buttons hold "Insert/...": "Insert qualifier", "Insert alias", etc.

<p>

Warning: this is not to add the corresponding qualifier or alias, etc
to the person, but to ask for a new form with a reserved place for
another qualifier, another alias, etc.

<p>

So, if you do "Ok" after having selected one or several of these buttons,
a new bigger form is proposed to you, and no updating is done yet.

<p>

Therefore, if, after an "Ok", you see a new modification form, this
means that your committing has not been recorded (not yet), even if
you filled a lot of areas.

<p><strong>Different fields</strong><p>

Remark the meaning of the different fields, specially the use of
"public name", "qualifier", "alias", etc which all have a very
specific meaning.

<ul><li>

<strong>First name</strong> and <strong>surname</strong> have their
usual meaning. With <strong>number</strong>, the person has a
unique "access key" as indicated in the beginning of this chapter.

<p>

We suggest to put the common first name in the first name area. The
other first names (complete first names, other possible first names,
other spelling of first names, etc) must rather go to the area "first
name alias" (below). The names with number as for noble and royal
persons must rather go to the area "public name".

<p>

This is because the first name is recorded in the list of first names.
It is possible to know what is the most frequent first name, see which
other persons have the same first name, etc. The other kinds of first
names would risk to be in one only exemplary.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Public name</strong> is the name the person is known
with. Example: "Edward VII" (his first name being "Edward" and his
surname "Windsor").

<p>

The persons having a public name are accessible in the navigation by
this name.

<p>

If there is a public name, it is displayed as a title in his personal
record, instead of his "first name surname" which are relegated below
and in smaller characters.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Image</strong> is a ".gif", ".jpg", or ".png" file associated
to the person and which will be displayed in his personal record. This
can be an URL address (starting with "http://...") or just a name the
system will search in the directory "images", subdirectory "base"
(where "base" is the name of the database) while displaying.

<p>

If you don't specify a file name, there is a default name.

<p>

This name is constituted of: the first name, a dot, the number, another
dot, the surname, all in lowercases, without accents and all the non
letter characters are converted into underscores.

<p>

Example, the person named "Anne-C&eacute;cile Dupont de Nemours" has
as default image name:

<pre>
   anne_cecile.0.dupont_de_nemours
</pre>

<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> search a file with this name
followed by ".gif", ".jpg" or ".png" in the above directory of the
images of the database.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Qualifier</strong> is the part of the name attached to the public
name for famous persons. So is "the Fat" for "Louis VI the Fat".

<p>

Persons are accessible with this qualifier at the place of their surname.
So "Louis VI the Fat" is accessible by "Louis VI" (public name), "Louis
VI the Fat", "Louis the Fat", "Louis Capet", etc. Let us note that
"the Fat" is nevertheless not considered alone as a surname.

<p>

There may be several qualifiers: so "William the Conqueror" is known
also as "William the Bastard". Therefore you need an area for the
qualifiers "the Conqueror" and another one for "the Bastard". This is
why the "Insert/Qualifier" is useful.

<p>

If there is a qualifier, the public name (or the first name if there
is no public name), followed by the qualifier are displayed as title
in the personal record, instead of the normal "first name surname",
which is relegated below, in smaller characters.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Alias</strong> is a name the person is known by, without being
an alternative for a first name (like the "public name" is, for example).

<p>

So, "Norma Jean Mortenson" is known as "Marilyn Monroe". Note that the
alias is in one part: no question to accept combinations like
"Norma Jean Monroe" or "Marilyn Mortenson".

<p>

If there are one or several aliases, they are displayed in bold small
characters below the title.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>First name alias</strong> may have several usages:

<p>

<ul>

<li> This can be the complete list of first names.

<li> This can be a little name used by the close relations: "Bob" for
"Robert".

<li> This can be another first name, or the same one but with a different
spelling, in case of persons of old times, whom first name is not
sure, or written differently in different sources.

</ul>

<p>

There may be several first names aliases.

<p>

First name aliases can be used in place of the first name in requests, but
they are not considered as real first names, i.e. they are not recorded
in the lists by first names, etc.

<p>

If there are first names aliases, they are displayed in the personal record,
in small letters under the title.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Surname alias</strong> can be used as alternative surname, if you
want to have another version of the name, e.g. with another spelling. Its
usage is not frequent.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Birth</strong> allows to indicate dates and places of birth and
baptism. No particular problem.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Death</strong> allows to indicate informations about the death.
No particular problem except the notion of "automatic choice" which we
explain here.

<p>

The "automatic choice" is present when the selection of the first menu
of the "death" area displays a "-". It indicates that one does not know
if the person is dead or not.

<p>

In this case, if you do not indicate any death date nor place, the
system chooses for you the fact that the person is dead or not,
according to his birth date: if he is less than 80 years old, it
decides "not dead", between 81 and 120 years old, it decides "don't
know", and more than 120 years old, it decides "dead".

<p>

If this automatic choice does not fit, you can select yourself the good
choice in this first menu, instead of the displayed "-".

<p>

Notice that the age of the persons whose death is "don't know" is not
displayed in their personal page nor in the anniversaries. Therefore, if
a person is between 81 and 120 years old and is not dead, select "not dead".

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Occupation</strong> holds the profession. If you want to put
a nobility title, use rather the fields "title" below.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Title</strong> holds a nobility title. There may be several
of them. To have a form with other places for the titles, click on
one or several "Insert/Title", go to end of form and do "Ok".

<p>

Titles are composed on two parts: the title itself and the place. The
title itself holds the designation: "earl", "duke", "king", etc. The
place holds the complement: "of Warwick", "of Saxony", "of England",
etc.

<p>

Note the particle: when displayed, you see the combination of the
designation and the place: "earl of Warwick", "duke of Saxony",
"king of England", which are clickable areas, allowing to see all
persons having this title.

<p>

But the separation of these notions allows to select, for example, all
the "earl", all the "duke", all the "king" (plural must not be used),
and conversely all titles ending with "of Warwick", "of Saxony", "of
England", etc.

<p>

The field "name" represents a public name associated with the title.
For example, "Charles Quint" is named "Charles I" as "king of Spain",
"Charles IV" as "king of Sicilia", etc.

<p>

The field "Nth" is used for titles used with a number. Example: for
the "5th duke of Hamilton", put the value "5". Do not confuse with
"Edward VII" whose number indicates he is the 7th "Edward" of the
lineage, not the 7th "king of Great Britain".

<p>

The button "Main title" allows to indicate, when this person is displayed
with a simple way (in the page of his spouse, for example, or in those
of his children), which title to use. This has importance only if there
are several titles.

<p>

The next two fields give dates of begin and end of reign.

<p>

To delete a title, just erase the contents of the first field "Title".

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Access</strong> allows to specify the access to personal
informations. This is applied to the persons of "nowadays", i.e. whose
dates (birth, death, etc.) are less than 100 years:

<p>

<ul>

<li> By default, the persons having nobility titles or one of the parents
of them has nobility titles are considered as "public" persons
and their personal informations are always displayed.

<li> When selecting "public", the personal informations are always
displayed, even if the person has no nobility titles.

<li> When selecting "private", the personal informations are not displayed,
even if the person has nobility titles.

</ul>

<p>

In "wizard" or "friend" entries (by passwords), the personal informations
are always displayed.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Notes</strong> holds the notes about the person. In the
personal record page, the text will be displayed without breaks, even
if you put breaks in your text. To add a real break, write "&lt;br&gt;"
where you want breaks to take place.

</ul>

<ul><li>

<strong>Sources</strong> allows to note short informations about the
origins of the informations: a name, an abbreviation, a book title,
a code. So you know where you got your informations from.

<p>

It is not designed to long informations, like "the copy of the document
found in the town hall": use the field "Notes" above for that.

</ul>

<p><strong>Committing</strong><p>

The committing takes place when you click on "Ok". As long as you do not
do it, no change is done in the base.

<p>

Remark also that, as it is said above, that if you selected one or
several "Insert/...", just a new form is proposed: this is <em>not</em>
the proper committing.

<p>

When the committing is really done, you must see a new page whose
title is:

<ul><li>

Either: <strong>Person modified</strong><p>

You see the name of the person and you can click on it.

<p>

Maybe you also see warnings. They concern dates inconsistencies.  The
update is done anyway, but it is preferable to fix them.

<p>

Clicking on the person, you see his personal record. But your
update may not be visible. Web navigators use to keep already
displayed pages in memory, and probably display the old version.
Do "reload the page" in your navigator to really see your modifications.

</ul>

<ul><li>

Or: <strong>Error</strong><p>

The page indicates the encountered error. Go back and fix it. You can
also give up... doing nothing and go on navigating in the base.

<p>

If the error indicates to you that some person already exists, it
means that you modified the first name, the surname or the number (you
have absolutely the right to do it), but your new choice is in
conflict with another person of the base.

<p>

Solution: go back and change the number. Remark that the error page
proposed you a free therefore available number. Take this one or
another. If there are several persons with the same name, their list
is displayed.

</ul>

<h4> <a name="DelP">5.5.</a> Delete a Person </h4>

You see this form, titled "Delete/Person" from a personal record, after
having clicked on "Update", then "Delete person".

<p>

The form only holds the button "Ok" to allow you to do it really.
You can still give up.

<p>

If you do "Ok", a new page appears with the title "Person deleted".

<p>

The person is not exactly deleted. His personal data is erased (included
his first name and surname) as well as his connection with his parents.

<p>

But an "entity person" is subsisting, linked to his possible spouse and
children.

<h4> <a name="SndP">5.6.</a> Send an Image </h4>

You see this form, titled "Send image" from a personal record, after
having clicked on "Update", then "Send image", but only if the data
base owner gave the <a href="start.htm#Cnf">authorization</a> for
that, and if the field "image" of the person is empty.

<p>

You can send (upload) a "gif", "jpeg" or "png" file which will be
associated to the person. This file is recorded in the site. If this
person already had a image, yours replaces it.

<p>

Note: if the field "image" of the person is not empty, you don't have
access to "send image". If you want to do it, do first "Update",
"Modify person", and erase the contents of the field "image".

<h4> <a name="DelPh">5.7.</a> Delete an Image </h4>

You see this form, titled "Delete image" from a personal record, after
having clicked on "Update", then "Delete image", but only if the data
base owner gave the <a href="start.htm#Cnf">authorization</a> for
that.

<p>

If you click on "Ok", the image associated with the person is deleted.

<h4> <a name="ChgC">5.8.</a> Change the children's names.</h4>

You see this form from a personal page after having clicked on "Update",
then "Change children's names".

<p>

All the person's children are displayed. It is possible to modify the
first name, the surname and the number of each child.

<p>

An interesting facility: when a child's surname is erased, the parent's
surname is automatically taken.

<p>

This can be convenient to change the surname of a complete branch: one
changes with "modify person" the surname of the ancestor. Then one
applies "change children's names" on the ancestor and one simply erases
in this form the children's surnames, which is a fast operation. Then
one restarts with the children.

<p>

It can be used also to fix the first name of a child. But if it is only
for a child, this can be done with "modify person".

<p>

<h4><a name="ShrtC">5.9.</a> Dates shortcuts.</h4>

<p>

In the "families" forms, it is possible to directly add birth and death
dates for the created persons. It allows to go faster when you add
these persons. You have also the following shortcuts about the
precisions of the dates:

<ul>

<li> "?1912" means "perhaps en 1912"

<li> "&gt;1912" or "1912/" means: "after 1912" 

<li> "&lt;1912" or "/1912" means: "before 1912" 

<li> "/1912/" means: "about 1912" 

</ul>

And for the year of the date of the "death" field:

<ul>

<li> "+" alone means: "died" (don't know when)

<li> "-" alone means: "alive" 

</ul>

<h3><font color=#2f6400><a name="MrgP">6.</a> How to merge two persons </font></h3>

This section describes how to merge two <strong>persons</strong> in a
database, if the case you recorded the same person twice.

<p>

Note: we do not speak here about how to merge two <strong>data
bases</strong>: this is treated <a href="merge.htm">elsewhere</a>.

<p>

The merge of two persons is rather manual, but constantly, you keep a
coherent database.

<p>

The principle is the following:

<p><ul><li> You select the two persons to be merged. But there, the
difficulty of their parents arises. If both have parents, their
parents must be first merged. And it is necessary to start again by
looking at the parents of the parents, etc.</ul>

<p>

It is therefore necessary to scan the ancestors until we find
"mergeable" ones. <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> does this work for you: it
indicates you the possible ancestors to be merged.

<p>

Here is how to proceed. Follow the instructions below while doing
your merge:

<p>

<ul><li> Take two windows of your navigator.</ul>

<ul><li> In the left window, search the first person to merge. </ul>

<p><ul><li> In the other window, the right one, search the second
one. </ul>

<p><ul><li> In both windows, do "Update".</ul>

<p><ul><li> In the left window, do "Merge".</ul>

<p><ul><li> In the form, put the first name, a dot, the number and the
name of the second person. You find that in the title of the right
window. Use "cut-and-paste", if you can.</ul>

<p><ul><li> Then do "Ok". From there, the right window is no more
useful. You can close it.</ul>

<p><ul><li> If the two persons are directly "mergeable" (at least one
of them does not have parents), <font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font> proposes to you to
merge them. Otherwise, it says that you must initially merge some
ancestors or some families.</ul>

<p><ul><li> If <strong>persons</strong> are to be merged (persons
themselves or their ancestors):

<p>

<ul>

<li> In the case of ancestors, the bottom of the form indicates the
two branches to be merged. With your assistance, it will merge the
top, then the intermediaries, and will end up merging the bottom,
those you requested initially.

<li> The form contains the values in conflict, if any, between the two
persons to be merged. Choose and do "Ok".

<li> You then see a form " Merge/Person" which is presented like the
form "Update/Person". Control the various fields, add, modify, remove
what you want and do "Ok".

<li> Now, the two persons are merged. If they were ancestors of your
initial persons, the page proposes to you to continue merging.  Click
on "continue merging". Advance until you have merged the two initial
persons.

</ul>

</ul>

<p><ul><li> If <strong>families</strong> are to be merged:

<p>

<ul>

<li> This happens when a couple of ancestors was merged. In this case,
two families are remaining. It is as if this couple had married twice.
It is thus necessary to gather the two families.

<li> First, as in the case above of persons being merged, select the
possible conflicting values and do "Ok".

<li> You then see a form "Merge/Families" which looks like
"Add/Family" or "Modify/Family". Do the changes you want. Notice that
some children can be displayed twice. Leave them: they will be merged
later.

<li> Do "Ok": the families are merged. Go on while clicking on
"continue merging".

</ul>

</ul>

<p><ul><li> Notice that in the forms for merging persons or families,
the displayed persons are clickable. You can click on them if you wish
to check that this merge is correct (go back with your
navigator afterwards).</ul>

<p><ul><li> Also note that you can stop at any time: your base remains
coherent and the merges you already did are recorded. You can ask
again later for the merge of your two initial persons, and the merge
restarts where you stopped it.</ul>

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400><a name="MrgF">7.</a> How to merge two families </font></h3>

To merge two families, first merge the fathers (if they are different)
and the mothers (if they are different) following the directives of
the previous section.

<p>

Then, from the father's page or the mother's page, do "Update". If the
two families are next to the other, you can see a "Merge" between
them.  Click on it. If they are not next the one to the other, use
"Invert" as many times as necessary.

<hr>
<h3><font color=#2f6400><a name="Dcln">8.</a> Languages with declinations</font></h3>

Some languages have declinations, i.e. the proper nouns and the common
nouns are written differently according to the place they are in the
sentence. It is the case of Czech, one of the languages provided by
<font color=#2f6400><b>GeneWeb</b></font>.

<p>

So the English phrases:

<pre>
   ... married with Vladana
   ... cousins of Vladana
</pre>

are translated in Czech by:

<pre>
   ... si vzal Vladanu
   ... bratranci Vladany
</pre>

<p>

The Czech first name "Vladana" has therefore several forms: "Vladana"
is the nominative, "Vladanu" the accusative, "Vladany" the genitive.

<h4><a name=Data>8.1.</a> Data entering</h4>

In the language lexicon and in the data, the cases are indicated by a
letter enclosed by two <code>":"</code>.

<p>

So in Czech, the accusative and the genitive are respectively
represented by:

<pre>
   :a:
   :g:
</pre>

<p>
	
In an update form, to enter a first name or a surname with its
declinations, the nominative has to be given followed by the code and
the form of each case. For example, for "Vladana":

<pre>
   Vladana:a:Vladanu:g:Vladany
</pre>

Two shortcuts are possible:

<ul>

<li> A form starting with '+' indicates that one must start with the
nominative: so "Adler:g:+a" means that the genitive of "Adler" is
"Adlera".

<li> A form starting with '-' also indicates that one must start with
the nominative, but removing the last letter ('--' for the last two
letters, and so on).

</ul>

The form with '-' can be used for "Vladana":

<pre>
   Vladana:a:-u:g:-y
</pre>

<h4><a name=Disp>8.2.<a> Displaying, documentation</h4>

In the page, only the nominative is normally visible. The other forms
are used only if the expressions of the language ask for them.

<p>

While browsing with a language without declinations, the nominative is
systematically displayed.

<p>

The complete form (with the complete description of the forms) appears
only in the update forms.

<p>

There is no documentation on the various used cases because it depends
on the language. The better way is to look at the lexicon. This can
be consulted from the welcome page by clicking on "lexicon" in the
bottom of the page. Look at the phrases corresponding to your
language.

<font size=-1><a name=note>Note</a>: in the person's "key", all
accentuated vowels are considered as they unaccentuated equivalents;
GeneWeb supposes that it is western Europe languages encoding
(iso-8859-1). It would not work, or give strange results if you try
other encodings (e.g. Cyrillic, Hebrew, Chinese, Czech).</font>
