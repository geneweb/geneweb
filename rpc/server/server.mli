(** [start ~interface ~port hdl] initializes an asynchronous RPC server based
    on a HTTP/1.1 server with WebSocket capability.

    The server accepts only HTTP requests that upgrade to the WebSocket
    protocol; all other requests are rejected. The content of WebSocket
    frames is expected to be a valid Request object of the JSON-RPC protocol.

    The server listens on the specified [interface] and [port].

    Optional parameters:
      - [max_connection]: Limits the number of concurrent connections per
        client if specified; otherwise, no limit is enforced.
      - [idle_timeout]: Specifies the duration (in seconds) after which
        idle connections are closed if specified; otherwise no limit
        is enforced.
      - [task_timeout]: Specifies the duration (in seconds) after which
        tasks are canceled. Note that this timeout may not cancel
        non-cooperative tasks.
      - [tls]: Enables TLS support if set to [true] and valid certificates
        and private key files are provided. If [tls] is [true], connections
        are accepted only through TLS.

    @raise Invalid_argument if [tls] is [true] but [certfile] and [keyfile]
                            is missing. *)
